1,"Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL"
1,"Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album.  Stevens blatantly rips off his own music.  I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece.  Do yourself a favor and start there"
2,"I bought this cd after hearing Tony on one of the am morning shows, and really likings some of his past offerings, but I have to say that this cd was the pits and a waste of my money.  I was ticked off to have bought this cd from a talented brother and not have gotten my money's worth.  Tony has been on the scene for quite a number of years, and I expected a more mature offering from him than this latest.  There is a great lack of maturity on this cd, and it's an overall disappointment.  Unfortunately, I have to say here that Toney is not alone.  What on earth possessed veteran soul singers the O'Jays to sing a song like Let's Ride?  Who are they singing about girls their granddaughters ages?  Hoochie mommas?  What?  Babyface?  Even he gets in on the foolishness of trying to sing like the hip hop crowd!  And what's up with the explicit lyrics?  We all know you can curse like sailors, but why is this language necessary in music?  And I know that artist have always performed their music, but will someone tell me why it's necessary to perform with so few clothes on?  I would rather hear your music, not see your booty! Sorry, but a review I just read triggered me, and I'd been thinking about the Tony Terry cd for a while.  Hope he comes up with a more mature offering the next time.  Meanwhile I think you're safe in skipping this particular cd"
2,"Um. I have nothing against bands that are ""mainstream"". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre.   I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?  If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song.   Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer."

1,"Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money"
1,Any one who is a fan of Luther Vandross will be sorry if you purchase this CD.  It's not a tribute.......it an abomination
1,"Anyone ever see any of these rap ""artists"" perform live? They're the most boring, derivative ""entertainers"" in the world. They walk up and down the stage grabbing their crotch and YELL their lyrics. They go from talking on records to yelling on stage. Quite a stretch. All this is done with about thirty of their no-name friends prancing around stage with microphones saying ""YEAH!"" ""UH-HUH!"" ""WHAT!"" ""THAT'S RIGHT!"" ""UH!"" etc. Get real.  Meanwhile, the only ""music"" provided is a backing track cued by some dude backstage. It makes for the most dull, predictable ""concert"" you'll ever see.   I can't wait until all this nonsense just disappears. In a world of common sense, these idiots would still be flipping burgers at McDonald's. "
1,"Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this"

2,"although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album ""musicology"" instead"
2,"Just listening to the samples of this new remix of ""GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters"" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly. Certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent Of Karen Carpenter and Richard as well. I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs? As another review noticed and I agree with, is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen's deep resounding truly perfect voice. This is not a CD you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of The Carpenters. The older CDs (if still in production or if you can find them used) ""Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary"" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally, is a much better pick. Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with. The other CD's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen's deep resounding perfect voice, would be The CD ""Voice Of The Heart"" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song. The other one I would highly recommend, if Christmas is your Holiday, would be ""Carpenters Christmas Portrait""... ""Special Edition digital version....Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best..."" with Karen and Richard. There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound,and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time. These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing. These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard. This new remix maybe OK if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs The Carpenter's recorded and later remastered-Not Remixed- sounded. For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating. These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans, took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song. Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver. As I more or less said in my Title for this review and taken from an old saying ""if it ain't broke don't fix it!"" or in this case Don't Remix it! "
1,"When it comes to Big Star's 70's output, you can call me a HOPELESS FANBOY, because after listening to In Space, it seems that ONLY a hopeless fanboy would think that thirty-some-years later, exactly one-half of the classic Big Star lineup could---or in forever difficult Alex Chilton's case, WOULD be so inclined---to attempt to recapture the lightning-in-a-bottle transcedent pop magic that made those 70s discs so great.  This disc has WAY MORE in common with Chilton's oft-times difficult, mostly self-indulgent solo work than with any of Big Star's previous fascinating pop near-perfection. While I'll admit that I have enjoyed a good chunk of Chilton's solo work, (in a slightly guilty, rolling-my-eyes, ""Oh...that Alex!"" sorta way...) my musical sensibilities are somehow offended by the fact that THIS group and that THIS particular collection of songs are presented as ""Big Star.""  In Space is connected musically to the original Big Star by little more than the fact that two of the same guys in THIS BAND were in THAT BAND.  If you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.    "
2,"The music on this album is performed so exquisitely; the orchestrations so subtle and yet illuminating, that one is almost tempted to forget what a ""What for?"" musical this is.   Donna Murphy plays the title character of Fosca, a hugely unprepossessing woman who suffers from more maladies than there are stars in the sky. She lives in a remote miltary outpost where she falls in love with the handsome, virile Giorgio. Giorgio in turn is having a torrid affair with the beautiful, but vapid Clara, a married woman back home. However from the time Giorgio comes into Fosca's sphere, she becomes this relentless succubus in her pursuit of him. She shows up EVERYWHERE he happens to be; her ferocity matched only by her inexhaustive capacity for self-pity. To depict Fosca musically, Sondheim comes up with the most monochromatic score of his career. Everything is SO lugubrious, dark, portentous, tragic; punctuated by militaristic strains (with snare drums)because the soldiers like to...umm...march.  In the end, Giorgio is worn down enough by Fosca's attentions that he succumbs. He believes he has fallen in love with her, shortly after which she...dies.  As I mentioned earlier, the material is beautifully performed (Marin Mazzie and Jere Shea render the opening ""Happiness"" with a marvelous sense of delicacy and sensuality. Donna Murphy evokes the proper pathos in the haunting ""Loving You.""), but you come away wondering what the point of it all is. If Sondheim is trying to show us how love is largely a chronic disease, then he succeeds admirably"
1,"Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares?  Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster.   One of the worst albums of the decade."
1,"Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out"

Notice his rhymes don't descend any futher than his mouth, his car and his money. What excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me? Does it reach artistic heights?  Or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame?   And still people eat it up like Chicken N Dumplin's on a cold winter's day  This is excactly whats very wrong with today's hip hop, it's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely  Stay away from this awful garbage  don't let MTV rob another cen"
1,"With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career.  While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original.  As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason.  Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood."
2,"Although it KILLS me to write anything less than glowing about Edwin McCain (I think he's probably the most talented singer/songwriter we've seen in the last ten years), I just can NOT get into this album.  Like others have said, I too have every Edwin album and have seen him in concert. I love everything he's ever done.... but this album just doesn't do it for me. And I know people will say... ""Give the album a chance""..... or... ""Let Edwin grow and move in new musical directions"". BUT..... I've listened to this album at least 10 times all the way through and it's just not growing on me. It feels ""flat"" and just doesn't feel EDWIN-ISH (if that makes any sense). Even Grammercy Park Hotel, which I saw him debut live and which is on his live DVD doesn't feel the same on here.... just doesn't have the feeling or soul.   I would pick up Austin Sessions over this album any day. THAT is Edwin doing what he does best. Maybe he feels the pressure to write some ""hits"" so that he doesn't have to spend two solid years on the road in the Black Pearl (his tour bus)..... and who could blame him??? But this feels like he's trying too hard.  I SOOOOOO hope he comes back with a better album next time, so I can rave about it, because although I gave this album 2 stars.... Edwin, as a person/singer/performer/songwriter deserves 10!!!!!!"
2,"This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single ""Wolf like me"" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very ""soulful"". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice"
2,You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment
1,It really doesn't appeal to me. But if you like them that is your opinion. I'm not going to say your stupid for liking them because your different from me. But I just feel that there is way to much cursing for my liking I mean the creativity here is not very high I just feel you could use better words. But I mean THE MEASURE OF A MAN IS NOT HOW MANY GIRLS YOU SLEPT WITH. I mean that is how you lose money on child support. Sex has never been the most important thing in life.  Honestly though I mean you just can't see these guys rapping about these same things when they're 40 right cause that is wrong. I mean why be interested in a group of rappers that in 10 years probably wont be making music anymore let alone still be together

Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a ""celebrity""  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke).

1,"one word.  generic.  terrible.  boring. (well, they are all one word)  people must learn to have a better taste in music.  granted there is at least one good song.  a few others are decent, but only because there are no vocals.  if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse ultra.  my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said ""thats enough"".  do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd.  when will people learn!"

2,"After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release.  To say the least I am disappointed.  I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep.  Where is the range of work?  All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating"
2,"I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful ""supergroups"".  Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more?  There's no such thing as a good supergroup.  The Supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck.  When Damn Yankees released their 1990 debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no hope for this band.  The whole album seemed rushed and thrown together.  They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their ""supergroup"" scam.  The big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow.  I guess they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me, it just sounds like a lot of filler.  Supergroups will always suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad!  Thats right people!  Supergroup members know that since they're already popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller----""Why bother trying to come up with good songs?  We're already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is! Lets just put out filler.""  Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more.  If you buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a sucker!  If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup"

I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic ""development"" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release ""young man's disease"" which is better than anything else i've heard this year."

1,Who could like a band like The Rolling Stones? They are not the world's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but Start Me Up and Shattered. Their new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard. Stay far away from that CD. Get anything from the Stones that contains Start Me Up or Shattered insted.
1,"let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with ""natives""?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive ""guesting"" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer. "

2,"There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.    With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience.  The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there.  One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes.  Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful.  Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard.  But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music.  One extra star in his memory."

He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again"

2,"The best scene in the movie is the Italian restaurant scene with Janeane Garofalo, using a wry Randy Quaid as her foil when she's not ignoring him.  It's the only scene that made me laugh.  The scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home, and the one preceding it when his girlfriend's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids, are both weak.  Playboy dad is not interesting, and that character really shouldn't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie.  The other dad, Reiser, is uncomfortable to watch.  His dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter, but that too is uncomfortable to watch.  The later scene, up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him, is completely unbelievable.  The fact is, that particular girl would not say those things to her dad.  She doesn't love him.  She doesn't need him at all.  She's done with him.  The stupid bit about Randy Quaid being a talk show star after busting into Rob Reiner's talk show is just dumb.  That doesn't happen.  If you want to write a cartoon, get Warner Brothers to draw it for you.  Have the Road Runner in it, or Bugs Bunny.  The film gives us comfort food at the end, with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids.  The fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young, but once they hit a certain age, in double digits, you are done.  Daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on.  Kids in their teens and twenties don't want or need anything but money from dad.  Fittingly, I saw this film on Father's Day.  To sum the whole movie up, Janeane Garofalo is funny, Randy Quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end, and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying.  The script doesn't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on.  But it takes a subject on, so at least that's something.  It gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family"

2,"A tenor very quickly on the rise, this is Villazon's second recital disc, one devoted to arias by Gounod and Massenet, all in sets of three, three for Massenet, and two for Gounod.  While still showing great promise, some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so, in the French repertoire, in part because diction comes up so short here.  ""O souverain"" from Le Cid continues to show Villazon's command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper register, so that the volume boosts from the control room are really unnecessary.  Diction here is already an issue, as many `u' vowels get dipthonged, especially when Villazon's sound is placed back for added weight and volume.   `La reve' from Massenet's Manon is comfortably floated, with support from Natalie Dessay as Manon enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number. Would Villazon been able to sing the short aria by Alain (who appears to the heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition - shades of Frau ohne schatten perhaps? - in almost a chamber opera), from Massenet's Griselidis (track 8), at least as softly and lightly, as both the music and dramatic situation require, this could have also been very successful.  He instead turns the ABA shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of it.    The less often excerpted ""Lorsque enfant"" from Werther closes out the first Massenet set, as does ""Pourquoi me reveiller"" the second.  Villazon's identification with the distraught main character of this opera is abundantly clear in both.  He capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies of the distraught main character especially well in the first selection, and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or sound engineers there as well.  It is quite curious how the control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that closes out the first section of the excerpt here from Massenet's Roi de Lahore, featuring a hero (from Hindu myth) that bound to certain stipulations, has literally returned from the dead.   Not quite as ostentatious as Massenet's near remake of Lohengrin, Esclarmonde (but with female protagonist instead), it is one of Massenet's most colorful scores. It has only been recorded complete once commercially, with Joan Sutherland, Luis Lima, and appearing only ten minutes apart, James Morris, and for the part of General unfortunately eliminated from this scene here, John Tomlinson, along with one other cut to Villazon's part.  It would've been more valuable to have all this complete instead of one or two other arias.  He captures the incipiently worried tone of Alim well, but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem that he has come from a place as remote from French culture as where the opera takes place.  Most successful of the Gounod selections are two of the three rarities.  The first is Source delicieuse from Polyeucte, based on the Corneille play.  It opens very well with a minute of orchestral cortege.  It perhaps has only been recorded once before and well, by Roberto Alagna ten years ago; Villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat well, if not as securely as Alagna.  Anges du paradis from Mireille (which Mirella Freni championed and recorded complete for EMI), is third, perhaps a study for Ah leve toi, soleil (Romeo), several years down the road.  The second Gounod rarity on this disc is ""Inspirez-moi, race divine,"" said to be a Caruso favorite, from Reine de Saba.  Its text indicates King Solomon's prize hired builder, Adoniram, to be a very confident, if mildly haughty chap.  Villazon's interpretation seems to portray a hero that constantly has to look behind his back, with all the incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and backphrasing Villazon engages in here.  The high C at the end, however, is convincing.  Such device as in the above, also accents and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from Romeo et Juliette.    ""Ah! leve toi soleil"" opens the first Gounod set, and is sung with the right ardor, conventionally marked by tiny captured scoops, coming off phrases.  Villazon's entrance and two later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat, and intonation gets momentarily derailed.  ""Salut, demeure"" from Gounod's Faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and monochrome.  Recitative and the beginning of the aria, ""Ah! fuyez"" from Manon begin well nuanced enough, and for the aria, truly softly as a change from so much else on this disc, but all-purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long. That leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two Massenet rarities, to close this recital - first, an aria from Roma, Massenet's swan song for the lyric theater and ""Ah! parais"" from Le Mage, opera with plot line similar to that of Verdi's Aida, following.  The melody, introduced by the cellos at the outset for the latter, somewhat takes after ""Pays merveilleux"" from Meyerbeer's Africaine, but in more voluptuous color, such as in Thais, and Villazon and Pido both capitalize well on its opulence.  Pido's work, on numerous other numbers on this disc, seems heavy, lumbering, cloying, or just simply out of his idiom, so to speak.  Word has it that Villazon, while not having a big voice, is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing.  How this picked up a major award from Gramophone, for the specific problems this disc has, and over two more qualified nominations (Ciofi/Di Donato Handel Duets and a Florez album) is mystifying. So much digression here is over the very specific demands that French opera makes on singers. There's much reason for hope for this tenor, but this disc, for two-thirds of it, does little to help fulfill it"
2,"The music for the soundtrack was so lame!  I though I was gonna cry cause I figured this was the end of B2K by this point.  The s'track wasn't even all B2K either.  I like the song with Jhene and Omarion ""Happy"".  Also I liked ""Out of the Hood"" other then that it was boring. "
2,"I bought this cd for one song, &quot;Walk Away&quot; which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away"
2,"So Far, So Good...So What! (in it's origional form) used to conjure feeling.  The remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just didn't quite hit the nail on the head.  If you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s, get your hands on that version. "

1,"Let me tell you, Shayne Ward is just one of those pop singers who only go by looks, if he looked like shrek he would not be anywhere today, face it girls your only buying this because you fancy him. Look at Justin Timberlake, where is he today, they go and move on, and thats what Shayne will do except alot faster. This song is so rubbish, the thing I hate so much is that he didn't even write this! So its not his own material, and let me take you in on a little secret he does not care about this song, its not like these lyrics mean anything to him, as he did not write. And on ""No Promises"" thats even worse than this, yes he might of wrote it I don't know, but does the song have depth, or is it just a plain old expected pop song. By the way it's the second one. Shayne Ward has no protential, neather does anyone who comes of X Factor, its all just one big [..."

1,"These guys are not artists. They are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene. It's like a few monkeys build a house, and all the other monkeys rave about it, but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat... whatever that means.  I am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio. Buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere."
2,"While I doubt I'll EVER get used to the edited (single?) version of 'Nights In White Satin' presented here, I have to agree that the song selection in general is excellent for a compilation of this seminal band.  That said, The Moody Blues (or more likely, their record label) haven't exactly been shy about releasing such anthologies and hits collections on CD, either.  While 'Gold' represents an affordable means of buying some of the best known and loved music from The Moody Blues, it also is for me one of the most trying listening experiences as well.  If I had to guess, I'd say much of the music contained on 'Gold' comes from different masters than the songs currently found on other collections, and on the band's original CD albums.  There are definite issues with the sonic quality of these songs as presented on this disc.  For instance, the music track of 'Nights' is horrendously compressed in comparison to earlier CD versions of this song; perhaps the record label was working with an unremastered single release master of the song (my guess), but the audible discrepancies between this version and earlier examples (albeit, in the full album form including The Late Lament and the full orchestral intro) are hard for this listener to stomach.  I can point to any of the earlier music included here and say pretty much the same thing.  Whatever the reason, the original source material used for this CD could've seriously benefitted from earnest remastering work.  While I suspect that would've raised the asking price of 'Gold', I also would contend that great music DESERVES such caring treatment.    As it is, too much of 'Gold' as issued is indeed quite tarnished, which in the real world given the metal that goes by periodic symbol of Au would've been impossible to do.  But evidently in realm of the corporate music world, when selling music on the cheap and banging out sloppily compiled CDs it's very easy to take the most precious and thoroughly muck it up"

1,"She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with ""Lo que son las cosas"" is just sacrilege at its ""best"" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment"
2,Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory. There are many Brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of Brahms from this CD..
2,"While the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded, there are way too many birds around. The CD describes their sound as distant and faint, but that's far from accurate. The parts of the CD where all you hear is the stream alone don't add up to more than 10 minutes, and never last more than a minute. For the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds, rather close and sometimes very loud.   Buyer beware: the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all! Very misleading"

5,"I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time.  Right from the first track, I was hooked.  ""All My Days"" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album.  ""Breathe"" has a subdued yet powerful message.  ""Home"" is just plain fun.  ""Song For You"" is sweet, somber, and hopeful.  However, I must say that the Four Songs version of ""Orange Sky"" is what I consider to be the greatest song ever written.  However, the Time Without Consequence version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the original).  The new version is too fast, has an inexplicably irritating percussion, and just doesn't dig into the soul the way the Four Songs version does.  I will always be baffled by this remake.  It is truly awful.  Its only saving grace is that the original is still available.  But that is by no means any reason to avoid this CD.  In fact, those who do not know the original ""Orange Sky"" may fall in love with this one.  But it is my duty to warn those looking for an ""Orange Sky"" that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed.  Outside of this single-song complaint, this CD has vaulted to one of the best I own"
5,"Too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern Christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on CDs like this.  John Rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting.  The music overwhelms the senses and the joy of Christmas overcomes you as you listen.  This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have ever heard.  ""Wassail Song"" is incredible, and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble, this song is a must to perform.  You will not be disappointed when you purchase this CD"

4,This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period
5,"This is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical, haunting scores ever composed for a film. Each succeeding track is a treat for the ears, refreshing and invigorating. Neeley and Varese Sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem.  In my opinion, though, the only part of the entire CD that doesn't work is the beginning of the ""Waxworks"" track - the score to this particular moment in the film (when Norma, watching herself onscreen, rises triumphantly to proclaim ""I'll be up there again, so help me!"") is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom. In the original, the music is strong, powerful and almost spine-tingling, but this moment on the CD is underwhelming and not fully realized. However, what is one misfire (totalling all of eight bars, at most) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording?!  In short, if you love film music, you most likely love the score to SUNSET BOULEVARD - and if you love SUNSET BOULEVARD, then you will most likely love this recording, too"
4,"With Engines of Creation, Joe Satriani did what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to use.   Only this time, he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar. It would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote ""Satch Boogie,"" ""War"" and ""Flying in a Blue Dream"" went.   Well, he's still here, only more than ever he's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey.   I've never heard robots having sex, but I'm willing to be ""Borg Sex"" isn't far off. And although his calmly passing, sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure, that's kinda how you'd expect to see ""Clouds Race Across the Sky."" The 'chorus' to ""Devil's Slide"" sounds as sinister as its name suggests and ""Attack"" is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as I've ever heard.   To top it off, the album includes ""Until We Say Goodbye,"" one of Satch's best ballads in his entire catalogue.  If you're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work Satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off Surfing With The Alien-style, you'll find that there's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found.   It's not a Satriani masterpiece, but its a true testament to the man's enduring creativity"

5,"I don't write reviews; my opinion is my own and it only matters to those who love me.  Still...""Amos Lee"" stands the test of time.  How long ago did I buy this CD?  I played it to death when I got it.  Had to go see Amos when he came to town.  Talked my sister into going with me.  ""You'll like him, he's low key, kind of jazzy-bluesy-folk music.""  Recently popped the CD back into the CD player.  It's still soooo good for relaxing, slowing down, chillin'.  My daughter surprised me when the music started.  She said, ""Is this Amos Lee?!! I love this CD.""  And she's a 13 year old (self-described)orchestra nerd who loves modern hard rock:  emo.  If you haven't gotten this one yet, but you've been thinking about it, stop waiting.  It's intellingent, sophisticated, difficult to classify, and won't get old"
5,"This is my first Donell Jones' CD, and I can truly say this is by far perhaps the best CD I've heard in several years by any artist. The tracks from start to finish are great, and I found myself listening to the CD all day the first time I played it. What prompted me to buy the CD was the song I'm Gonna Be which I hear more on my satellite radio stations than I have locally here in Michigan. And because of the quality of music, I very rarely buy CD's anymore, however, after hearing I'm Gonna Be, I was telling a friend how much I liked that song and my friend happened to have the CD and only after listening to maybe 3 or 4 other tracks, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  I LOVE THIS CD - GREAT JOB, DONELL !!!  What I am disappointed in is the lack of promotion for this CD.  It just burns me up when there are some non-mainstream artists with a great product and for whatever (dumb) reason, the marketing depts. of the record companies that don't actively promote artists such as Donell Jones who have quality products.  There isn't even a video out, which in this day and age, an artist must have a video to further promote their product(s). So shame on JIVE RECORDS (and all the other record companies) who don't actively and aggressively promote CD's with the quality that this one exhibits.   I recommend this CD to anyone who can appreciate good quality R&B - both youngheads and oldheads (I'm an old head in my mid-40's).   I have been doing my own promotion for this CD and will contact my local radio stations to ask that they include I'M GONNA BE in their rotation.  "
1,"Their first album &quot;Let's Get Free&quot; was a 5 star masterpiece, unfortunately this one is horrible.  There are only 2 good tracks on this album, both which are deep and reminiscent of &quot;Let's Get Free.&quot; One is &quot;Sellin D.O.P.E.&quot; and the other is &quot;Look Around&quot; which is already featured on Beatnuts' &quot;Musical Massacre,&quot; and to make things worse they chop off 3 minutes of the song.  The other tracks are boring and uninspiring.  They completely changed up their entire formula as if to impress the commercial heads who know nothing about real hip hop.  The beats are either recycled or &quot;snare- happy, throw them bows&quot; type beats that are for a whole different crowd of listeners then their first CD.  It's much like a book with no pages.  Shine with no substance.  It's too bad that with their first joint they dropped a gem on us and then with this one strayed away from their roots.  I'm optimistic that they will soon get back to the old Dead Prez formula that made &quot;Let's Get Free&quot; so great.  But until then, don't pick this one up"
2,"Wu-Tang Clan has seen better times.  I remember a day when you couldn't help but love everything Wu put out either as a group or individually.  Remember the good ole days of Enter The Wu-Tang, Liquid Swords, Tical, Only Built For Cuban Linx, and Ironman?  Now years later, the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim.  Don't get me wrong, Ghostface Killah laid it down with his latest album Fishscale.  But Clifford Smith a.k.a. Method Man is a totally different story.  4:21...The Day After continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling.  There are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic ""Is It Me"" or the posthumous verse of ODB on ""Dirty Mef.""  You can even accept songs such as the Lauryn Hill assisted ""Say,""  the Erick Sermon produced ""Gotta Have It,"" or even ""Let's Ride"" featuring Ginuwine as being decent.  One thing that's become obvious is the fact that he can't hold it down alone like he did with Tical.  But a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we've become accustom with from Method Man.  I mean, ""Somebody Done F*cked Up"" has some energy, but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once.     The majority of 4:21...The Day After is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both Method and his guest artists.  Streetlife brings his wackness to songs like ""4:20"" and ""Everything"" (the latter also features an uninspiring verse from Inspectah Deck.)  And you would think putting Method, Rza, and Raekwon on a track would be a banger, but ""Presidential M.C."" comes and goes without much fanfare.  Other weak selections include ""Konichiwa B*tches,"" ""4Ever"" featuring Megan Rochell, and ""Fall Out.""  I honestly can't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21....The Day After except to complete their Method Man collection.  This album won't get much pub from Def Jam and it seems Method Man is going through the motions at this day in his career.  Everyone had high hopes for Method Man's career...but it seems like the only high he'll be getting is with a blunt."
1,Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him
2,"Frist of all this is  an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams"
5,"I can't explain how powerfully this album moves me. At first listen, I was disappointed. There was no ""Night of the Swallow,"" no ""Moving,"" or other rousing songs that make me want to dance, alone, in the night.  Then, I read someone's review which spoke of listening to this album in a dark room alone. I made time for this album. Time alone for me is scarce, but I missed Kate and made room for her. We cooked together, went on long walks, even went running once or twice. I fell in love with ""Sunset"" first. The flamenco guitars, the rhythm picking up, the multiple sky images. I listen to this and feel one with the sky. It is such a positive, beautiful album. Listening to it feels like a religious experience.  This is not party music. It's not for socializing either. I had a good friend over and I just wanted to tell her to stop talking so I could soak in this beautiful, beautiful music. Kate's voice is softer here. She wears her motherhood comfortably, and it shows, yet she still has that incredible vocal range.   I had thought that there was no surprises left in music for me. I was wrong. That doesn't mean I like all songs equally. I listen to the songs on the first disk (especially while running), but it's disk 2 that captured my heart. ""Sunset,"" then ""Nocturn."" Then, sweet ""Aerial:""  ""I want to be up on the roof I've gotta be up on the roof Up, up high on the roof Up, up on the roof In the sun.""  I am trying to say that this album is a visceral experience. You have to live it, immerse yourself in it, give yourself over to it.  For those of you disappointed with it, I recommend giving it another chance. Especially listen to it outside. I think you might yourself similarly entranced as I was."
4,I liked Trouble but I think this CD is a little better. I like the musical arrangements better  this time around. The addition of John Medeski and Chris Wood give the music a deeper more full sound. Trouble sounded mostly like Ray playing an acoustic guitar. Where Till the Sun Turns Black really has some excelent backing musicians. Lyrically I like both about the same. I say to get both discs they have alot to offer.

2,"Dem Franchize Boyz drifted around the ATL music scene and dropped a number of independent releases, but then their song ""White Tee"", while not necessarily becoming a major hit by Billboard standards, did give them some brief attention. But that's nothing compared to the popularity they've received thanks to their latest album, On Top of Our Game.  I personally don't see what the big deal is about this album. Before I listened to it, I thought I would be annoyed by all the snap music, but it turns out that the problem isn't necessarily the music itself, but the below-average lyrics that all four members of Dem Franchize Boyz put on wax. I never was that impressed by ""I Think They Like Me"" (an obvious single because it's censored), but the thing is, that's actually the best song on the album.  Many of the songs feature all-too-familiar subject matter, like cars (""Ridin' Rims""), bling-blingin' (""You Know What It Is""), and hardcore sex (""Freaky As She Wanna Be"" -- and why does Trey Songz keep wasting his talent like this?). The choruses can get a little uncreative too: ""Don't Play With Me"" has ""B, don't play with me"" while ""Stop Callin' Me"" has ""B, stop callin' me"" (by the way, calling the latter song wack would be an understatement). And ""They Don't Like That"" makes me wonder if they were reading our minds.  The production also tends to get repetitive; when I heard ""Suckas Come and Try Me"", I felt like singing: ""I think I think they like me!"" And the remix of ""White Tee"" is unnecessary, especially because they mention their white tees in just about every song on here. I'm also starting to think my brother was right when he suggested that D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz are the same group.  The only thing more annoying than the group's rapping is when Damon Dash shows up on ""Bricks 4 the High"". No, he isn't rapping; he's instead talking -- no, not talking; WHINING about severed ties with Jay-Z and Roc-a-Fella (*sigh*...is he still talking about that?). In the end, while I wouldn't call this the worst So So Def album ever (Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1 gets that honor), it's pretty darn close. If this is Dem Franchize Boyz at the top of their game, what does rock bottom look like?  Anthony Ruper"

1,"..these 3 have worldwide status and have produced some amazing tracks so I can't understand why they put this out. The album lacks quality, imagination, energy, and inspiration. There isn't one G funk influnced track on the album but a lot of slow/mid tempo stuff. I've tried listening to this twice and managed skipping the whole CD in a short space of time. To you Gangsta listeners out there, don't waste your money....i ain't gonna go on any more about this album so if you don't believe me..buy it"
2,"First of all, this album mirrors Bright Eyes in so many ways, it's almost ridiculous. He sings about photographs, NBC, drinking. Bright Eyes song Old Soul Song is all about developing a photograph. Let's Not Sh** Ourselves has Conor yelling about NBC, ABC, and CBS (two of which An Angle has in Change The World) and Bright Eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs. Also, Kris has mastered the Bright Eyes singing style. This is not a negative thing, it's just very similar.   But as for the album itself, minding the bright eyes comparision, it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece. That being said, at least it's on the road to a masterpiece, albeit far far away. Songs like True Love and A Way With Words are fantastic and shine on the album. Songs like White Horses and Green Water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else Kris has to offer. But too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking ""when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk?"" Songs like Born in a Bottle and Angry Drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring. Going back to Bright Eyes, the only reason that songs like The Big Picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant. Kris doesn't have this lyrical ability yet.   However, I am excited about the future of An Angle. I think in the next coming years if Kris can mature a little, both musically and lyrically, he'll make an album that's brilliant. An album like Bright Eyes' ""I'm Wide Awake It's Morning"" (which I believe is his best). Maybe he should just lay off the drinking."
1,"ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE ON OTHER ALBUMS.  This is an audio recording from multi-media presentations.  Much of the material is geared around visuals and Anderson's stage personnae.  This is like listening to a television broadcast of a football game without the picture.  You get the general idea what is going on, but you miss a lot.  It is not like listening to a football game over the radio, where the broadcasters explain what you aren't seeing.  Without the visuals to go with this CD, many of the stories and jokes come up flat.    This CD set is about 4 and a half hours long.  It was taken from several years of Anderson's live shows that eventually became the United States.  Each CD more or less covers a specific ""tour"".  Her back up band changes from CD to CD.  You can tell that as time goes on, she gets more famous (and maybe has more money) she is able to add more to the shows (and her backup band gets bigger).  The sound quality is amazingly good.  It is sharp and crystal clear.  There is almost no audience noise, which does help create a good atmosphere for her stories.  About 80% of the material is spoken word.  There is some music.  It is probably less than 45 minutes of the total 4 and a half hour production.  The recordings come from early in her career.  She later redid most of the best material and put in on other albums.    I would suggest getting her other CD's.  Or if you want to see her performance art work, I would suggest searching out the Home Of the Brave VHS tape (I don't think it has been released on DVD).  Don't get the Home of the Brave CD"
2,"This came out when I was 12: it would have been far too 'difficult' an album for a young whippersnapper and I was only vaguely aware that the Bunnymen existed at that time. In my early teens I bought a few Bunnymen singles and Ocean Rain; now, 24 years later, I'm trying to fill in the rest of the Bunnymen jigsaw.   After a week of repeated listening, I'd say you can try on this album in either of two ways. Either, you judge it by its stand out songs, which are far and few between: if you can listen half a dozen times and manage to hum more than 2 tunes afterwards, you're doing better than me.   Alternatively, you can put it in context: appreciate that this was a pretty original approach at the time and marvel at the uncanny proto-U2 sound, (which I have to say does precious little to endear it to me). If you're interested in exploring music history largely for its own sake, it's worth hearing in order to understand how we got from Joy Division to U2 within a couple of years. However, if like me you think both Joy Division and U2 are vastly overated, this really isn't going to do much for you.   It's determindly bleak, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but this also captures the Bunnymen at a stage before they got a knack for melody: only 'Over the Wall' and 'A Promise' deliver a decent hook. I've seen Heaven Up Here described as a work of 'rare beauty'. It can also cause a tense, nervous headache.  If you're interested in the early 80's British underground scene, then of course you should hear it, along with the other Bunnymen albums. Compared to the lush Scott Walker-esque Ocean Rain, though, this is half-baked and less than half-rewarding."
2,"Never a Beach Boys fan I had to listen to this much hyped album after hearing rave reviews. What a dissapointment. I just don't get it. &quot;God only knows&quot; is indeed a masterpiece, but the rest of the album is  filled with boring music that does nothing for me. I've tried multiple  listenings to make sure I'm not missing anything, but the plain truth is  that this album stinks. I was expecting some deep music as described by  some Beach Boys fans, but the best use I can get out of this album is using  it as a coaster. In a word, BORING"
1,"Very bad selection of songs, most of them you alredy have in others Bee Gees collections like number ones or the record.  It would be much better if the producers choice new songs like country lanes, or tears and remaster them.   Any real fan can make a better list"
5,"This proves that Scarling is an original and creative band, far surpassing Jack Off Jill. All JOJ fans can be sure, that Scarling is no JOJ reborn, but is it's own band, inovative and brain-tickling. What a refreshing break from the norm! ~Mirlin Popla"
5,"Now, I know I'm not the only one that realizes that critics barely know what the hell their talking about. I must admit that the first time I heard this album I was not that thrilled by it. But the more I heard it, it quickly became one of my favorites. I think this album is very underated and quite brilliant. I believe that this album allowed Prince to develope as an artist in a big way."
5,"Simply put, this is a classic. The album is basically perfect and not one of the tracks are 'fast-forward-able'. Black Thought gets better with each release and the band seems to get tighter and tighter with their chemistry and sound. The guest appearances are great too. This is the album that clearly defined them as the pioneers they are"
5,"Every time I listen to this album, I have to jump up and down!!!  Lot's of fast tempo beats and super fun lyrics!  I highly recommend it"
5,"First off to avoid any conflict of interest claims I admit that I an a huge Rod Stewart fan. That being said, I just wasn't interested in hearing him do the old American classics(which I also love). I just didn't see how he could do them justice, that is, until I saw his DVD ""Live from Royal Albert Hall"" in which he did several of the songs from his first ""Great American Songbook"". I was just blown away. These songs were now his. I went to the computer to order one of the CDs but my wife talked me into getting all three and I am surely not sorry. I believe that there are very few CDs available with no weak tracks(there are some) but here are three that just don't have a weak track(IMHO). He has made all of these great songs his. My all time favorite song is ""Stardust"" by Hoagy Carmichael. I had never heard a version that I thought could top his, until now. If you love the old standards you should really give these 3 CDs a listen. They'll melt your heart!!!"
1,"This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead."
4,"Disc 1.  Buskers who have been together long enough to tighten up, play inside each others' moves, and develop a distinctive style all their own-dusty folk songs about a hard life they love.  Subdudes come to mind.  They document life on the road, in a beloved Australia, and their personal lives in up-close personal terms.  Striking phrases of lyrics repeatedly grab my attention. They fans love them and they love entertaining them.  Disc 1 is a revelation.  [72:04]  Disc 2 offers more of the same.  Maybe too much of a good thing all at once-the distinctive style gets a little claustrophobic.  And yet, I want to hear more.  Watch for last track.  [68:15] "
1,"This is typical political hip hop. Rants, slander, and completely moronic and asinine conspiracy theories. All accompanied by weak beats, bad lyrics, and terrible performances by M(oron)-1.

1,"I grew up listening to Bob Dylan, and was really looking foward to his his new DVD, Modern Times, and was really disgusted when i tried the bonus DVD in two dvd players i have,and lent it to a friend to try,and neither one of us could get it to play.I should have returned it,but after my friend tried and failed to get it to play,as stated,i was just disgusted. I desided not to order any more music DVDs from Amazon.I must say that the  music on the first DVD was great,starting with Thunder On The Mountain,it was good to listen to some new Dylan."
5,"Laurie Anderson recently applied for and was hired as kitchen worker at McDonald's hamburger joint near her studio in Manhattan. Huh???...yes it's true, and she recounts her McDonalds experience in her new performance piece, ""Happiness"". Laurie Anderson can find beauty in strange places. At Town Hall, eight short days after the collapse of the Trade Towers, Laurie found beauty in a terrifying place. She performed ""Love Amoung the Sailors"", from her Bright Red album and the lyric...""There is no pure land now, no safe place...If this is the work of an angry God, I want to look in his angry face..."" ; becomes a prophetic statement of iron willed resolve. ""Let X=X"" takes on a new meaning as we, the listeners, are placed in an aisle seat of a burning plane.  George Bush talked about ""wanted dead or alive"" and ""hunting down terrorists like dogs"" and Laurie Anderson talked about the phenomena of flaming birds in the sky after the American planes became guided missles from hell. Now, one year later as Sadam becomes the ghost of Osama, I look to Laurie Anderson's concert at Town Hall as a defining moment in a Brave, New World. Laurie Anderson (not Rudy Guliani) is New York's first citizen and the heart and soul of this planet, Earth"
5,"Man, what can I say about this album but CLASSIC!!  Prince was 23 when he dropped this one and forever served notice to the world that he was a different  kind of kat and that the whole scape of the pop world as  we had known it at that time was going in HIS direction!  Never one to conform or confine himself to any one  particular musical genre, he delves into new wave & punk  (Dirty Mind, When You Were Mine), then grooves us with the nasty but infectious ""Do It All Night""... Then he goes into the album's only slow jam, the lamenting ""Gotta Broken Heart Again"", which is a classic to true Prince fans who go all the way back with him!  Then Side 2 opens with the punk-funky ""Uptown"",  which truly captures the vibe of the times of pre-aids, experimental, ambisexual, free-lovin'  late 70's / early 80's america!-- Which is the world that I came of age in!  (I was 16 when this album came out and it  seemed that Prince was reading my mind!)  Then at the end of ""Uptown"" there's a cool  synthesizer effect that swooshes us right into  the classic gut-bucket synth funk of ""Head"",  which is self- explanatory!  Then, at the end of that, the same synth swoosh  takes us into Prince's tabu tale of incest as a streetkid  of 16 who lives (albeit antagonistically!) with a half sister of 32 who is determined to teach  him her warped view of the facts of life or else  ""Put him on the street again!""-- A punked-out, rockin', fast-moving piece  that caused quite a stir back then! Then the synth swoosh takes us to one of my  all-time fave Prince ""Party Til' You Pass Out!"" jams.... ""Party Up""!! This song sends this classic album out with a bang!  The ""Dirty Mind Tour"" of late '80 and early '81 was  quite a spectacle to behold! Prince broke all the  taboos of sexuality, fashion, staging and just brought  a whole new energy to the game that just caught  you on fire!  He was the opening act (at that time!)  for then ""supposedly"" notorious Rick James (RIP),  whose ""Fire It Up"" tour was all the rage!  But to those of us who were lucky enough to see it,  it soon became apparent that Prince's flame  made poor Rick's look like a bic lighter! After about 3 months of what was supposed to be  a 6 month tour as Rick's opening act,  tired of being upstaged, Rick James fired Prince from  the  tour and harbored a bitter resentment of him which  lasted up until about a year before his death in 2004  when he had to finally acknowledge that Prince Rogers Nelson was indeed a true genius and a force of nature!   If you don't have this album in your collection,  you're short-changed 4-real!"
4,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!  I love this raw sound of the White Stripes that doesn't sacrifice the melody.  Jack shows he is one of the best rockers out there (and Meg, well, you gotta love Meg!).  Standout tracks are Seven Nation Army (which sounds like Salvation Army), Ball and Biscuit (I love to crank up the solos!), I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself, You've Got Her In Your Pocket, and even In The Cold, Cold Heart (You go Meg!).  Yes, the drums are choppy in places, but it works well with the White Stripes and you gotta admit - there is no one else like them.  They are original and are here to stay"

2,"I bought this CD based on the reviews for my 2 yr. old. Some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense. My daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song. (""There's a Little Wheel A-Turnin In My Heart"" and ""Pig on Her Head""). I really didn't like ""I'm a Mess"" which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter. I would recommend instead Karyn Henley's CDs which I found to be the best out there for the toddler age group (3-5 yrs). She tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter. The songs are wholesome and innocent"
2,"Out of this whole CD, I could only pick about 3 songs that I liked.  This CD is very disappointing and some of the songs were down right annoying.  The best songs on here are Everything Part I, II/ Bow Before The King and Victory.  Past those songs, there is not much because I can't bear to listen to the rest. Those two songs get 1 star each"
2,"This CD is fun and musically intriguing, but not appropriate for kids... one song talks about ""what can you do in a case like that but stamp on your mother, and your toothbrush, and on everything that's helpless."" Another talks of being an immigrant to the country and says ""and they beat me, and they banged me, and they left me on the ground."" And another says ""I'm a great sharpshootress. There is nothing that I can't shoot in the eyes, or the ears, or the teeth, or the fingers."" Musically it's fun and goofy and intriguing, but I was appalled when I realized what I was encouraging my young child to listen to. "
1,"This band claiming to be hopesfall is not! There is only one original member left, they should of changed their name with the release of atypes, no question. Atypes is a disgrace to the people who grew up with hopesfall in NC! I would have respected them if they changed their band name"
1,"How can a group fall as far as they did?  ""Who Can You Trust"" and ""Big Calm"" were both classics (dispite the fact that they sounded totally different from one another).  Now with ""FoF"" it just went down hill...and never came back"
2,"I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's"
4,"This CD re-release of their 1981 album has been substantially enhanced by the addition of many previously unreleased tracks. It opens with their masterpiece Wheel Me Out, an eerie and evocative piece with addictive beats and strange interpolations by vocalist Liz Weiss.   The hit title track is a funky rap, Where Did You Heart Go? a mellow soulful ballad with great sax and Tell Me That I'm Dreaming a complex piece with many samples and unusual vocal arrangements.  Oh Mr Friction has a jerky rhythm, meandering saxophones and rap-style vocals, whilst Carry Me Back To Old Morocco has an innovative instrumental mix and fun lyrics, reminiscent of their James Brown song. It's An Attack with its delicious sax patterns is closer to a rock song but with a jazzy edge, whilst The Sky's Ablaze is a spoken poem with minimal instrumentation.   The additional tracks provide a wider perspective on the virtuosity of this unique band whose music remains hard to categorize.  My favorites are Christmas Time In Motor City and the dub version of the title track.   The list of vocalists and instrumentalists on this innovative album is quite phenomenal. Was (Not Was) certainly contributed to making the early 1980s a very interesting period in popular music."
2,"I am a Common fan. I have all of his projects and go out of my way to get all the music that he is featured on or artists that he aligns himself with personally. If he's on it or likes it, its alright at the very least. Or at least thatw what I thought.  This Album was indeed eccentric to say the very least. Unfortunately, what many do not realize, is that just because it is different does not make it good. This album is not good. The same socially conscious message is there for the most part and that is the only reason I dont give it a one. The Production overall is horrible and though the message is the same, the lyrics are not quite as sharp. His worst effort clearly.  Some cat on this page said that it is better than Can I Borrow A Dollar and One Day It'll All Make Sense........he's on some extremely potent narcotic drug to say that. He cannot beleive that himself. That is the most single ridiculous critique of a solid Hip Hop album that I have ever heard. Nothing personal, but I by no means agree with him and neither would any other head who has heard either of the albums. He's CRAZY!!"
5,"When you listen to a cd, why do you listen to it? Simply because it sounds cool, or you enjoy how it relaxes you, or it fits a certain atmosphere? If that's how you listen to cd's, don't bother getting this album. I wouldn't want you to. This album is best enjoyed by those who listen to something because they get the feeling inside of it. I don't know why so many people here call this album pop and lighthearted. I completely disagree. The lyrics are not particularly dark, as opposed to maybe, lyrics from Alice in Chains' ""Dirt"", but they aren't exactly happy either. I absolutely love them. ""Sleep Spent"" is a great song. There is a lot more to this album than everyone seems to let on. The key to DCFC's music is that it takes a lot of listening before you actually get it, and the emotional value begins to sink in. I have been listening for three years, and just in the last six months or so, has the meaning of their music, the emotion behind it, the depression, sadness, and confusion finally begin to show themselves through the tone of Ben's voice and the guitar riffs. I'm not suggesting this is a depressing album, in fact it's rather comforting. Most of their albums are."
1,its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it
1,"I've probably listened to ""crane wife"" several dozen times (one of the perks of working for a hipster clothing retailer) and after rolling meloy's lyrics around in my head for a month or so i can honestly say that he has created the pirate-prog rock song cycle of the year, which somehow is not as cool as you'd think it might be. what i really don't understand is the slavering fanboyism this band seems to inspire within some ""intellectual"" music fan circles. just because you need to use a dictionary to decpiher meloy's overblown dickensian narratives doesn't make them well-written or intelligent. instead ""the crane wife"" is the newest addition to the recycled 18th Century story sketches meloy doesn't seem to be able to depart from. maybe i'm just too picky but lyrics such as ""Produced my pistol, then my saber to make no whistle or thou will be murdered"" from ""the island"" come off as extremely silly, especially when filtered through meloy's extremely nasal delivery. the ""crane wife"" titled-tracks produce some interesting images, but ultimately lose their effectiveness due to meloy's weakness for 10-dollar-words. overall, the whole album sinks under the weight over over-writting, over-singing, and over-playing. meloy and co. should put down the dickens for a little while and read some william carlos williams.

2,"I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it"
1,"I put one star because it's the minimum, if not, I would've gave it zero stars. This CD can be reviewed in so few words... here are some: NO!!! Don't Bad Stay Away from it I told you, NO!!!  In short, no music from the movie is here, and the music that is here... well, it might as well not be here, and it would it be better that way.   Summary: NO!!! don't get this CD, use the money in something else, get a hamburger or somethin"

5,"If I were to rate the packaging, I would have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the way it was made, I've had the discs fall out several times myself.  But it's a beautifully packaged and recorded document(in its appearance and sound) that I listen to constantly.  One problem I have when I look at the roster of talent, is I'm reminded or our own mortality; so many of these people are now dead, and the era that followed can never replace what was here. That could be good, though, they all sound so alive here, enhanced by one of the best bands ever to grace a stage.  As an aside, I wonder why people call a death  ""passing away,"" or just ""passing."" They didn't ""pass,"" they died; there's no shame in saying it. Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, Paul Butterfield, Muddy Waters, Carl Radle, and Pop Staples are all dead; go ahead, say it. I don't think they'll mind. Nobody flinches at the word ""suicide"" when talking about Richard Manuel, but let Rick Danko peacefully drift off in his sleep, and he ""passes away."" These things have always puzzled me.  Back to the music; it's all good, so much talent crossed that stage that night, the audience had a real treat. The Band's songs cover such a wide spectrum of topics, and I understand the guys resenting Robertson's appropriation of the writing credits, but these are men who have definitely walked the walk, and because of that, they are certainly able to talk the talk. You can hear the heartbreak in Rick Danko's delivery of ""It Makes No Difference,"" and the effects of the hard life in Richard Manuel's voice in ""The Shape I'm In,"" and even more so in ""Acadian Driftwood."" His voice here is hoarse and ragged and PERFECT. Levon Helm summed up Manuel's demons quite well in in The Band's ""Authorized Biography,"" and in his book, ""This Wheel's On Fire."" He said ""That's between him and his Higher Power, and I've always tried to keep from having too much of an opinion about it."" He is still shaken over it this many years later, you can see it in the video, because here, he just clams up, takes a big drag on his cigarette, and looks off somewhere into the distance. I can see in him a sense of betrayal by one of his closest friends, and the knowledge that it will always hurt.  This is relevant to ""The Last Waltz,"" because there was a sense of brotherhood with these guys, from the beginning, all the way through, until huge success started to splinter that element. They were so good, and to watch this, knowing that these five will never grace a stage or studio in this form again, has the feeling of ending, of winding down, and being forced to say goodbye when you don't want to say goodbye.  Even though the sequencing is out of order, and there were a few omissions from the show, it's still a magnificent document of one of the greatest live performances of the era, one of the best"
1,this ablum mad me loose a lot of respect for this band. dont bull this . get some of there earlier stuff
4,"i didnt have the most remote idea that i was going to like this album this much. My only experience from the band was Clint Eastwood and recently Feel Good, which even though i thought it was great i wasnt too crazy about it.But i recently watched the whole Demon Days album played at the Manchester Opera House and...oh man! i was totally blown away! the performance waas amazing, i totally loved the songs, and all the energy that is coming from that stage makes you get up on your feet and start singing too. God! i wish i could have been there!i had to buy  the cd, love kids with guns, dirty harry, last living souls. Even the soft and mellow songs are amazing. I was talking to a friend when i started watching the DVD and i had to put the phone down.if you like something different, away from the ordinary, catch Damon albarn this time"
4,"When I think of Greg Dulli, I think, why isn't this guy in more cigarette commercials? Also people have told me that I look like him, so I always want to check out with my doppelganger is up to. In the 1990s, Greg Dulli carried the weight called the Afghan Whigs and challenged everyone's attention largely on the force of his personality. That is so me. Outside of Kurt Cobain, Dulli is the only real charmer from ten years ago. His music was honest and cool and had R&amp;B and Motown sophistication. Dulli now peeps his head over the fence with Blackberry Belle. Dulli pissed his territory with songs about love and suicide in a style of a smooth operator. His voice is more confident than ever.  His new outfit seems more musical than the Afghan Whigs which were limited to their usual rock and rock paths. This is like when Nick Cave left the Birthday party to do much more stylish music on a bigger scope. I think Barry Adamson and Kid Congo are available for employment. I look forward to more records and shows"
2,"A not bad recording of this, in my view, poor and rather over-rated show. Amazing orchestration and the performances of Bebe Neuwirth and Joel Grey stop this recording from falling in the gutter of musical tattle. The cast is nothing to get excited about quite frankly, although Bebe Neuwirth is a real treat as Velma. I wish the same could be said about her co-star.     Reinking, with her voice similar to the noise of clattering shovels, manages to (allbeit in the ""Broadway-darling"" style we have grown accustomed to) take awfulness to great new heights. The only thing that is good about her performance, quite frankly, is when it stops... reminiscent of that blissful moment when people stop playing bagpipes. Having said this, her acting is great, giving the character of Roxie depth and meaning - however ancient she portrays her. This is something Gwen Verdon tried and failed at. On balance though, Reinking's badness outweighs anything else, sadly.      Neuwirth with her ""older"" style of voice and singing makes her seem to own the role of Velma Kelly here, although she does over-do the older-portrayal sometimes.       Joel Grey lights up this recording with a superb performance and with much ease. On the whole, this isn't the best recording if this show I've heard, but its certainly not the worst.  A good buy if you know the show well, but, apart from that, steer clear for now.   "

4,"I grew up in the 80's, during the heyday of great dramatic metal bands like Iron Maiden and Queensryche. Now that I'm older (and a professional musician myself with years of classical training), I can recognize the cheesiness of the bands that I loved when I was a kid. But I can still listen to a lot of that material and appreciate the musical and poetic ambition, the theatricality and the grandeur that the bands of that day were earnestly striving toward.  I got ""Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge"" for free, and I probably wouldn't have even given it a listen if I hadn't been so intrigued by the cover art (which it turns out was done by the lead singer of My Chemical Romance). I'm embarrassed to say that I just associated this band with legions of mindless teeny-bopper fans and I couldn't even imagine liking their music. In retrospect, I see that that is an insult to the band and to its fans (who are clearly on to something).   It's been a long time since I've been excited about a rock band. The last five or six years have been discouraging ones for mature pop music fans. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like, in the wake of September 11th, 2001, we've been awash in nostalgia acts: The Strokes, The White Stripes, The Killers, The Scissor Sisters, Jet, Gnarls Barkley, Franz Ferdinand and the like. These are acts that deliberately attempt to evoke another era, not only with the sound and composition of their music, but also by the way they dress and even by their bands' names. It's true that pop music has always mined the past for inspiration, but these ""retro-parody"" acts, as I call them, shamelessly attempt to recreate a specific musical sound of an earlier time without bringing any stylistic innovation to the artistic process; the music could easily be mistaken for material recorded 20 or 30 years ago. And while I actually like some of the work being produced by these bands, I feel that this approach represents the worst kind of artistic cowardice, for it allows the artist to hide behind a veneer of irony. Like foam trucker hats, this kind of art mocks the style while copping the style at the same time. The artists puts nothing of himself into the art, and therefore risks nothing. In a day and age when real life seems dark and complicated, it's easy to understand the appeal of retro-parody music; it transports us to an imaginary time when life was simple, even simplistic, and when nonsensical music reflected that simple-minded aesthetic.  The more I listen to ""Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge"", the more I admire the sheer audacity of this record. The first time through, I couldn't shut it off; the album is a RELENTLESS attack of high-energy pop/punk, replete with rhythmic drive, wailing guitars, infectious hooks and lots of screaming. Even so, I thought the album might be a bit much for me- a little over the top, a little too dramatic. But I was intrigued by the lyrics, which seemed to be trying to tell a story, so I went online and poked around and found out that ""Three Cheers"" is in fact a concept album that tells the story of a man who must kill 1,000 evil souls in order to be reunited with his lover. I also found an interview with the band where they explained that they intended ""Three Cheers"" to be completely dramatic, theatrical and totally over-the-top; I'd say they succeeded on all three counts.   I realized that My Chemical Romance is a kind of anomaly in today's pop music sphere. They represent the rare breed of artist who is willing to take a huge risk for the sake of making an original artistic statement. No one out there is doing anything remotely like this; while MCR might sound stylistically similar to other bands out there, I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the only band making big, dramatic, SINCERE concept albums (in the line of ""Operation:Mindcrime"" and ""Seventh Son of a Seventh Son""). I emphasize the word ""sincere"" because I think it's hugely important to the MCR phenomenon. While retro-parody acts mimic and mock the style and dress of 70's and 80's bands for a cheap thrill and a quick buck, My Chemical Romance clearly recognize that the great music of those decades was written with sincere intentions, and this is manifest in MCR's own music, which reflects the influence of their predecessors without ever sounding quite like any of them (you'd never mistake My Chemical Romance for an 80's or even a 90's band).   The fact that My Chemical Romance is hugely popular among people half my age (I'm in my early 30's) almost turned me off to the band. But I'm starting to realize that this kind of musical snobbery is self-defeating, and when it comes to pop music it may be that teenagers are sometimes more likely to recognize a good thing. Pop music critics, most of whom are my age or older, naturally fawn over the retro-parody acts, as these bands validate, by obsequious imitation, the music of the critics' own youth. But while the critics live in the past, I'm not surprised that MCR, whose lyrics sincerely and directly reflect the moral ambiguities of our own troubled times, have found many loyal young fans.  When you think about what this band is attempting on ""Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge"", it's actually pretty amazing that they pull it off. It would have been less surprising to see a band with this kind of grand artistic ambition simply fall flat, getting bogged down in solipsistic lyrics and ornate, melancholy music. But that doesn't happen here, because these guys have the talent, the wit, and the chops to make it happen.   The music, in fact, is probably the most surprising thing happening here. Forgetting for a moment the concept, the hype, the theatricality and all the rest, no one can dispute the fact that there is a high degree of musical talent at work on this album. Sure, the songs are basically formulaic- most good pop music is. But the songwriting is solid, accomplished and unique. The single ""Im Not Okay"", for instance, with its carefully-plotted and infectious vocal line, could almost have been ghost-written by a professional songwriter; but the quirky lyrics mark it as unmistakably original, an irresistable anthem for a new generation . It's easy to lose sight of MCR's strong compositional skill under all the screaming and the eyeliner, etc., but, to me, that makes it all the more admirable- the fact that the musical artistry of this band is never thrust in your face as something to be admired; it's just quietly at work, the motor driving this mad machine.   Not only are the songs remarkably well-crafted, but the execution of the songs is impressive, too. The sound of the band is incredibly tight, with dual guitars dominating the music texture. The lead singer does a lot of screaming, but also a lot of really excellent singing. He has a semi-obnoxious, but clear and strident voice, and a pretty wide vocal range. Forceful and propulsive, the album is pretty much a shot of musical adrenaline from start to finish, with a short interlude (track #8) that works to break up the texture a little bit. The only thing that prevented me from giving this album a full five-star review is the fact that tracks #11 & #12 tend to lag a bit, not in musical energy, but simply in content; they seem somehow like slightly meandering, B-level songs that might've been cut if the album were longer. But track #13 brings the record to a satisfying conclusion.   My Chemical Romance is a genuinely talented, skilled and honest band making an all-out attempt to deliver bold, artistic statements with each album; for this, I think they should be commended. Whether or not you like their music is entirely up to you, and I don't think a distaste for this type of adventurous stuff necessarily reflects badly upon the individual listener- just give MCR props for being artistically courageous"
5,"I'd first heard of Lupe Fiasco on a track off of Kanye West's album ""Late Registration"" called ""Touch The Sky"" i said to myself man this guys good. As 2006 rolls around I kept hearing his first single ""Kick,Push"" on the radio I knew I had to get this cd when it came out. When I opened it and first played it in my truck OH MAN it was like opening your first present on christmas day. I couldn't stop playing it from ""Real"" to ""The Emporer's Soundtrack"" and the track that makes you think of the special girl in your life ""Daydreamin"" featuring Jill Scott, this is album you should DEFIANTLY add to your collection.

4,"This is generally regarded as Public Enemy's best album.  It's easy to see why, because it does feature many of their best songs.  Like ""Bring the Noise"", ""Don't Believe the Hype"" and ""She Watch Channel Zero"".  Believe the hype"
1,"When are we gonna start boycotting this bubble gum pop bull S%%T! Lil john is one of the worst emtertainers on this earth. His flow is rough and terrible and he wastes beats on a regular basis. I guess all of the zombies and sheep won't appreciate me dissing this retarded muppet but someone has to stand up and say something. This album is a just like a vicious string of herpes infecting the youth of many nations. We need some hip hop penicillin like KRS ONE, Mos Def, and kwel"
4,"Loreena McKennitt's music will evoke other artists such as Enya and Kate Bush (when she's in full Celtic mode).  McKennitt seems a bit more earnest in her seeker stance, and there's nothing wrong with that.  It does probably mean that she may not reach everyone, especially those listeners who are less of a mystical bent.  There is precious little irony or skepticism here, so it pretty much helps to be on the same spiritual page as the artist herself.  Or at least to be able to temporarily to suspend your lack of belief.  I did after a few listens, and I found myself coming back for more.  New Age Music has its own kind of ""hooks,"" and it is unlikely that once having heard the exotic arrangements here that you will be able to get them out of your head very easily.  Her European hit ""The Mummer's Dance"" is particularly haunting.   Unlike some of the reviewers below, I have to recommend this album with a few caveats.  It may be hard for fans to realize that this really WON'T be everyone's cup of herbal tea.  But then what is?  Although I can think of one or two people I wouldn't bother playing this for, if you like your music Romantic (in the original sense of the word) and your lyrics appropriately diaphonous, well, you can't do better than Loreena McKennitt. "
1,Brandon Cruz is trying to recapture something he never had. His credibility as an artist. Why else would he redo the songs written by Kyle instead of writing his own? Kyle toucher was the backbone of Dr. Know! I am utterly amazed at how Brandon can take truly amazing songs and butcher them beyond recognition.I recommend &quot;The Best of Dr. Know&quot; if you want to hear these songs as they were intended
2,"Contrary to the concert of praise surrounding Lang's virtuosity, these memories have little to do with music. Is fingerbreaking pace, music? The scherzo of Chopin third sonata says it all: it's all about how fast Lang can play, not at all about what Chopin's music means. The score -written by the decidely stubborn Chopin- doesn't acknowledge Lang's change of tempo: there is no such thing as the slow part in the middle. Once again this music shows how well out of his depth this virtuoso is and how much hype, marketing and fashion of the day are propping these automats. I'll take the impetuous Argerich over this anytime: at least she is genuine. Her scherzo is organic, fluid. A recent CD by pianist Svetlana Ponomareva displays similar qualities and although in the obscurity as much as Lang is in the sun, she follows Chopin's score in a meaningful and sensitive way. Check the soundclip on her website [...], compare with others on amazon, listen! "

2,"""Raw?""  ""Energetic""?  ""In your face""? I honstly can't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ISM is any of those things. Energy level is close to that of ""The Trinity Sessions"", but this band doesn't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills, for that matter - of the Cowboy Junkies, so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever.   Capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not IMHO improved by the very free application of reverberberberb, against a background of lethargic mush. Coming soon to garage sales all over the country"
4,"Outkast has always been an unbelievably creative and experimental group. Arising from the south, which is typically plagued with no-talent wannabe-emcees who can't seem to keep their platinum teeth off each other's rectum, they manage to always provide conventional and beautiful music. Their dope debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was just a mere introduction to their skills, and would only pave the way for their untouchable classic known as ATLiens. On this superb sophomore LP, Outkast gave us an unbelievable grouping of introspective and thought-provoking music, with their own P-Funkish beats. Their experimentation only continued on their third album Aquemeni, which is yet another superb album. On this one, Big Boi and Andre 3000 experiment with some new sounds, go for some new creative subject matter, and slow down the tempo on a few notes. Their most recent album, 2000's Stankonia, showed how dynamic they were, giving us a mix of unbelievable, up-tempo party jams, feel-good music, and of course, the signature introspection. 2003 promised Outkast's return, and they indeed delivered.   Firstly, Speakerboxx/The Love Below are two albums packaged as one. Speakerboxx is Big Boi's album, and The Love Below is Andre 3000's solo effort. Each member of Outkast basically star on each album and provide their own musical landscapes and styles. They each released a single, one per album, hence making this feel as if it is two different albums, and in fact it is. Therefore, for my review, i will review it as two separate albums, to keep the comparisons separate throughout the majority of the review until my conclusion. Keep in mind as you read the review, before i begin, that both albums are VERY DIFFERENT, and i will review this with an open mind and as a true fan of Outkast, which i am... enjoy...    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Firstly, i will review Big Boi's album Speakerboxx. Big Boi's disk is loaded with the typical Outkast sound, keeping the experimentation level on a minimum. Big Boi has always been a dope lyricist, so i look forward to listening to this album with high hopes that he hasn't fallen off. The guest list looks pretty impressive, including some big mainstream names, and a couple of lesser known names. Still, Big Boi is the star, and he has proven in the past that he can carry the mantle. Let's hope that the same applies here.     Track List & Rating: ""Speakerboxx""   1 - Intro (NOT RATED)  2 - GhettoMusick (3 1/2 Stars)  3 - Unhappy (3 Stars)  4 - Bowtie f/ Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha (4 Stars)  5 - The Way You Move f/ Sleepy Brown (4 1/2 Stars)  6 - The Rooster (3 Stars)  7 - Bust f/ Killer Mike (4 Stars)  8 - War (4 Stars)  9 - Church (3 1/2 Stars)  10 - Bamboo (Interlude) (NOT RATED)  11 - Tomb Of The Boom f/ Konkrete, Big Gipp & Ludacris (4 Stars)  12 - E-Mac (Interlude) (NOT RATED)  13 - Knowing (4 Stars)  14 - Flip Flop Rock f/ Killer Mike & Jay-Z (4 1/2 Stars)  15 - Interlude (NOT RATED)  16 - Reset f/ Khujo Goodie & Cee-Lo (5 Stars)  17 - D-Boi (Interlude) (NOT RATED)  18 - Last Call f/ Slimm Calhoun, Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz & Mello (3 1/2 Stars)  19 - Bowtie (Postlude) (NOT RATED)      Big Boi's half of this double album, known as Speakerboxx kicks off with a skippable intro, which then leads us into ""GhettoMusick"".   The synthesized beat immediately kicks in, making you think that it would be some sort of up-tempo techno track. After a bit of the beat playing, we get some quick, danceable, party music and Big Boi kicking off a flow. The sound of the song is fast and smooth, perfect for those long high-way drives. Big Boi sings for the first part, and raps for the latter part. I like to consider this an introductory track, experimenting with techno, R&B, and hip-hop elements. As a sidenote, id like to say that i am a huge fan of experimental music. I love it, which is why i enjoyed the most recent experimental musical albums such as Phrenology by the Roots and Electric Circus by Common. When classic, well-respected artists decide to cross into new styles of music, its always interesting and fun to me, and those with an open-mind.   ""Bowtie"" features the southern, P-funkish elements which make Outkast who they are. Featuring some slamming trumpets, that typical Dungeon Family singing, and some nice guitars, Big Boi drops some pretty dope lyrics about a certain female who can't seem to get off his mind. The track might seem a bit commercial, but its a pleasure to listen to due to the lyricism of Big Boi and the dope production done by Jazze Pha (who is typically a commercial producer, but has his moments). Big Boi proves on this track that he is indeed still a dope rapper, and has yet to fall off.   ""The Way You Move"" is Big Boi's lead single.   Big Boi's unbelievably creative lyrics adds some nostalgia, taking us back to the groups' extraordinarily light-hearted work found on Aquemeni. The production is one of those pieces that will be stuck in your head for ages to come, with its pounding trumpets. The background R&B/soul vocals only add to the song, giving the song an unforgettable, seductive feeling to it. Big Boi's mic presence is unforgettable, and this is an ideal lead single for Big Boi.   Killer Mike joins Big Boi on ""Bust"". The melodic production is dope, and the background vocals are reminiscent of some of the silly singing found on D-12's debut Devil's Night. Killer Mike and Big Boi drop ill introspective verses, reminiscing about the past. The production is, as expected, loud and pounding, but also melodic and listenable. Immediately with the first listen, you can tell this is an Outkast track, and a damn good one at that.   ""Church"" has the incredible makings of a classic, but is shut down by seemingly annoying and overabusive production. The subject matter revolves around Big Boi questioning his religion due to the problems surrounding not only himself, but the entire world. Big Boi mixes introspection with some creativity and heart, backed by some thought-provoking lyrics. Lyrically and Subject-Matter-wise, this track is dope, but the production and organization needs a lot of work. As i said earlier, youve got to have an open musical mind and be a fan of true hip-hop lyricism and elements in order to fully appreciate the experimental sounds found on Speakerboxx.   Skipping ahead we arrive at ""Flip Flop Rock"". A commercial Jay-Z joins Killer Mike and Big Boi on this dope introspective collaborative crew joint. Big Boi touches on street violence, racism, and oppression that is seemingly killing the blacks of this country, as well as the other kids in the streets. Big Boi's introspective lyrics and political views are interesting, and add a new twist to those who doubted how ill of an emcee he is. The melodic hook is one of those dope ones, but soon Jay-Z appears on the track and gives us some egotistical, somewhat materialistic lyrics. I dont understand all of the hype over Jay-Z's Black Album due to the fact that Jay-Z is nowhere near showing me that he is going to change, and turn underground again. His verse on this song is very commercial, and leads me to believe that his so-called ""final"" album might just be a repeat of other washouts he's had in the past. I sure hope not... because the heads deserve a LOT more.   Its interesting that the Dungeon Family themselves provide the first true classic on Speakerboxx, that being ""Reset"".   Cee-Lo and Khujo Goodie from Goodie Mob join up with Big Boi to give us the dopest song on Big Boi's disc. The slow-tempo production and haunting background vocals provide an amazing atmosphere, and a somewhat nostalgic trip back to the days of the classic ATLiens, where Outkast gave us a classic-filled album of this caliber. Big Boi, Cee-Lo and Khujo drop some memorably DOPE introspective verses, touches on the evils of the world from government, to racists, to life itself. The overall feel of the track is unbelievable, as it is a true classic.   Speakerboxx is nowhere near being as good as any of the previous Outkast albums by themselves. Its obvious to me that Big Boi fits a LOT better with Andre 3000 than without him. This album, unlike his partner's disc, stays true to hip-hop and retains the traditional Outkast sound for most of the tracks, along with a few new soundscapes and experimental sounds. This album incorporates lots of guests, but the majority do a great job and manage to keep up with Big Boi. A lot of the songs are bangers, and it stays at a great level of quality, but nowhere near the classics that they have put out in the past. However, Speakerboxx is a pretty dope stand-alone album with its share of hits and misses.   3.75 Stars      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Moving On, we now arrive to Andre 3000's somewhat solo effort, known as The Love Below. This is about as farfetched as Andre has ever gone in his career. Experimentation and Eclectic music is the name of the game here, as Andre gives us some unique musical landscapes, touching on every single musical style thinkable, from jazz, to soul, to R&B, to hip-hop, to rock, and beyond. As i said at the beginning of this review, i am a huge fan of experimentation by artists who have already proven themselves, thus i fully respect Andre's decision to explore his creativity as he has done on The Love Below. Staying true to hip-hop is something that i treasure, but Andre has proven in the past that he is capable of doing that, so i will review this album on a completely unbiased level.     Track List & Rating: ""The Love Below""   1 - The Love Below (Intro) (NOT RATED)  2 - Love Hater (4 Stars)  3 - God (Interlude) (NOT RATED)  4 - Happy Valentine's Day (4 Stars)  5 - Spread (3 1/2 Stars)  6 - Where Are My Panties? (NOT RATED)  7 - Prototype (4 Stars)  8 - She Lives In My Lap f/ Rosario Dawson (4 1/2 Stars)  9 - Hey Ya! (4 Stars)  10 - Roses f/ Big Boi (4 1/2 Stars)  11 - Good Day, Good Sir (NOT RATED)  12 - Behold A Lady (4 Stars)  13 - Pink & Blue (2 Stars)  14 - Love In War (3 Stars)  15 - She's Alive (4 Stars)  16 - Dracula's Wedding f/ Kelis (3 Stars)  17 - My Favorite Things (NOT RATED)  18 - Take Off Your Cool f/ Norah Jones (3 Stars)  19 - Vibrate (3 Stars)  20 - A Life In The Day Of Benjamin Andre (5 Stars)      ""The Love Hater"" kicks off The Love Below with some already ecleptic music. The song captures an unbelievable early decade style of mo-town jazz, which im sure older musical fans will be thrilled to listen to. The piano melodies and trumpets give the song a very Tom Jones-like feel, where singing was the main operative. Of course, Andre 3000 isn't just an ordinary artist, and i consider him one of the true innovators of not just hip-hop music, but all sorts of musical styles. Fans of the traditional Outkast style might shun at this, but for once, listen to Big D: It helps to have an open mind.   The album continues with ""Happy Valentine's Day"".   Kicking off with a thumping bass kick, drums, and claps, we immediately get some funky guitars. Immediately you know that Andre decides to experiment with a funkish style of music on this track, with a tiny ounce of R&B and Soul. Andre's singing talent is off the charts, and i truly believe his skills are largely underrated. The background singing vocals give the song a unique, early 70s soul feel, with some funk. When it comes to subject matter, Andre stresses the importance of ""Valentine's Day"" and how love makes the world go round. Forget your typical rapping here, Andre once again sings, and does a damn good job of it.   Andre 3000 goes to pure R&B/Soul with ""Prototype"". The song title doesn't exactly sound like it would be a love song, but it is. Throughout the majority of the song, we have a nice soulful vocal display by Andre, along with background synthesizers, guitars, and pianos to add to the mood. The slow-tempo feel of the song gives it a relaxing atmosphere as Andre shows off once again his vocal skills.   ""She Lives In My Lap"" is an unbelievable display of honesty, even though its not exactly the same opinion that I have. Andre deals with the fact that he seemingly cannot stay in a relationship because of the mere fact that he keeps females and enjoys their company hoping to get into their pants. The subject matter is honest, yet shallow due to the fact that Andre can be easily critiqued for not giving a f*ck about a women unless she f*cks him. He admits it on an honest level, and behind an unbelievable mix of vocals and production. However, i wonder if he was actually telling the truth, or if he just wanted a little bit of controversy and/or needed a song idea. Who knows?   Up next is Andre 3000's lead single, entitled ""Hey Ya"". The fast tempo, guitarish beat giving the track an amazing light-hearted feel. However, besides the excellent, fast tempo production, Andre 3000 spits fire with his amazing vocal display. The song has a very mid 50's sort of quirky feel to it, making it one of those songs that many heads are afraid to admit they enjoy. Me? I love it. The beat is tight, the singing is amazing, and its difficult for you not to enjoy this melodic musical medley. I feel as if Andre chose the perfect lead single, just like i felt Big Boi did on his album.   ""Roses"" and ""Behold a Lady"" are eerily similar love songs. Both songs feature some seductive, R&B/soul vocals directed to a woman. Keeping the familiar Outkast P-Funk, mixed with new forms of music and nice melodies is something that Andre has seemingly perfected the art of doing this merger. The second track of the two is a much more up-tempo track, with a tiny bit more seductiveness to it, and some more appeal. The synthesized melody is different than the last, proving that the only familiar parts would be the seductiveness of the vocals and Andre's choice of subject matter.   The Love Below hits a speed bump with ""Pink & Blue"". I appreciate the elceptiveness of the album, as long as it makes sense. What we have here is a cadre of sounds put together in a fast pace, making the song sound like a complete mess, and almost unlistenable. Thusfar, this is the only extremely weak moment on either album.   Skipping ahead past some of the average moments of The Love Below, we get to the closing track, strangely titled ""A Life In The Day Of Benjamin Andre"". Believe it or not, Andre does something on this track which he has yet to do... and thats RAP!!!! Unbelievably enough, Andre ends his disc with what brought him to the fame in the first place. Production-wise, its pretty simplistic, with drums, a clap, and some weird background effects. This song feels a lot like something that was pulled from ATLiens, due to its simple production and song concept. The subject matter is creative as f*ck, as Andre uses his ""art of storytelling"" to summarize his entire life into one day. The song has no catchy hook of any sort, but that doesn't matter due to the fact that Andre gets personal, even touching on his relationship with Erykah Badu. A fitting close to Andre's disc.   The Love Below is eclectic, unique, and at times just plain bizarre, but its primarily good. The musical variety is shown, and Andre's maturity and growth as an artist is something to give praise about. His disc is filled with mainly good or great songs, and pretty much only one flaw. Old-school Outkast fans probably wont dig it too much unless they have an open mind, and most likely neither will backpacker heads. However, i truly believe that this is an album not only for hip-hop fans, but for fans of all music respectfully.   4 Stars     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     In listening to Speakerboxx/The Love Below as a combined album, i often wondered if Big Boi and Andre 3000 could really separate and keep apart without losing a tad bit of the quality. I mean, lets be honest, they are an unbelievable duo and their different points of view as well as rhyme styles create a wonderful landscape of lyricism and music. Apparently, they indeed prove that they can. I honestly had no clue what to expect from this album except that i honestly trust Outkast to give us good music, and im glad i did. I always walk into an Outkast album with an open mind set, and i always walk out with a smile knowing that they have yet to make a bad album.   The question on many fans minds is: which album is better? Well, in my own personal opinion, Andre 3000's album is slightly better and much more consistent this time around, and the music is unbelievable. However, Big Boi's album is much more true to hip-hop with lyricism and such. My conclusion to this is that i highly appreciate that Outkast gave us 2 discs this time around, but i believe that they belong together in order to give us the true classics which they are more than capable of. Their experimentation is great, and this album will always be treasured by their fans, but i do believe that their part should only be temporary. It was dope how its 2 discs for the price of one, and thats even MORE the reason for me to reccomend Speakerboxx/The Love Below. It is a dope album loaded with stuff to please everybody... so get yourself a copy as soon as you can.   Overall Rating:  4 Stars "
5,"I don't really write reviews but I wanted to throw in here that this is a great album, because there are so few reviews of it.  If you liked his first you will like this to; I don't find either one any better or worse.    Also, watching that video they've got on this amazon page, he seems to be pretty great live.  But really, there's not much else to say: If you liked his first, you won't be disappointed by this one. "
5,Wow - this cd set has it all!  I particulary like the 4th cd and play it all the time for my 3 month old.  You'll definitely enjoy hours upon hours of kiddie music
1,"Emo noisemaking and Christian themes. The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad. Disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the Disco scene. The same happened with Hair Metal and Nu-Metal. Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity. As I always say in my reviews, this is trash and should be treated so accordingly. This band should take their Emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity."
5,"....I have found that Incubus' masterpiece ""Make Yourself"" is much more of an obscure Progressive Metal album than a Nu-Metal album. Take some deep listens into this album, and you will see that the musical progression of each song fits perfectly into the moniker of Progressive Metal,with a lot of funk, Hip Hop and Nu-Metal tossed into the mix. Each song progresses with perfection and every note played is placed in just right. Even Brandon Boyd's amazing vocals are progressive, as is the concept of the album, which is making yourself out of your own ideas, thoughts and beliefs, not letting the Government, Authorities and the world shape what you believe and feel. The guitar riffs are intricate and amazing, as is the funky bass lines and the tight drumming. The DJ adds much atmosphere and ambience to the record as well. Brandon's vocals are superb, having a wide range and deep metaphoric lyricism. I took this album for granted ever since I first picked it up, but in the new perception that I am in now, I appreciate it much more. I feel that it takes time for the true goodies hidden in the compositions of this album to come to the surface, and a face value listen won't reveal anything beyond a great ""Nu-Metal/Rock/Funk"" record. I think this is Incubus at their finest(which many would argue with, citing ""Science"" as their best. True, I feel that Science is amazing as well and shows elements of Progression, but its ""Make Yourself"" where they reach their pinnacle). Do yourself a favor and pick this album up, if you can get past the whole Nu-Metal Stigma, you will find a true gem that is worth many repeated listens"
4,"Nina Persson's ""debut solo album"" (as described on the promo sticker) began life in Sweden in 1998, the same year as the Cardigans' Gran Turismo. It was completed in America throughout 2000 with producer Mark Linkous from the excellent Sparklehorse, during time off from the Cardigans, which had clearly taken on a life of its own, not entirely of her choosing.  A Camp was born in 1997 after a meeting with Niclas Frisk, who co-wrote most of the songs and plays on several of them. Boyfriend Nathan Larson (from Shudder To Think) also plays on all but one of the tracks and co-wrote the opening song. Frequent Flyer sets the mood of the album as it opens with eerie samples, theremin sounds, thuddy drums and Nina's gorgeously bittersweet vocals over an engaging melody. In fact the tunes retain a high standard throughout and the quirky production (though mainstream by Sparklehorse standards) is never less than complementary and interesting. Angel Of Sadness is a stand-out song although I Can Buy You made a first class single. Although the album consists mostly of original material, a few stray covers shoe-horn their way in - the Replacements' Rock 'n' Roll Ghost; bizarrely, Restless Heart's old US hit The Bluest Eyes In Texas; and Walking The Cow, one of the best known songs of cult singer Daniel Johnston, whose 2003 album Fear Yourself was also produced by Mark Linkous. A Camp manages the delicate trick of being unmistakably, instantly belonging to Nina Persson whilst at the same time being quite distinct from the Cardigans. May her future projects be as successfu"
5,"I've been a fan of the Cardigans ever since their first CD release in USA and when i've heard that some band members were doing solo I was very anxious to hear them.  I think that Nina's CD is art in its purest form.  Each song is carefully put together like a collage to form a trully unique piece.  I found my self experiencing different moods as I listened to each of the songs.  Some other very good songs were actually not released on this cd.  Songs such as &quot;Charlie Charle&quot;, &quot;My Misery is my Mystery&quot;, and &quot;What the hell are you crying for?&quot; but dont worry you can still hear these songs.  For those of you who don't know Nina has a special website for her CD its : http://www.acamp.cjb.net/.  There she has an option of listening the unreleased songs.  I hope this review has helped you in some way"
1,"Wow, another buncha poetry school dropout pouting girls clutching ""banjers"" and ""gitars"" wearing old dresses and ripping off Appalachian and southern culture while the ripping off is good. Tune in next year and the BGTs will be putting out a Calypso record. Another one for the ""No Depression"" poop pile"
2,"The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either.  The primary reason for buying this CD was the song ""You Are My Sister"", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing"
1,"Ok first off I love radiohead -pablo honey up through the electronic swarms of Kid A, as well as the avant-garde Amnesiac. So I guess I am confused why I DONT like this...  it's boring? it's like white bread, flat and blah... and with no real substance? Thom isn't covering any new territory here lyrically, or melodically.  The electronics don't supplement his voice either... each song opens with inessential spastic ticking of naked techno beats...then a layer more or two before Thom chimes in with a droning melody that sounds like he's dragging his feet over routine tones.   I'm left understimulated and quite unimpressed. I even question Thom's concept of quality... Surely he knew that this was subpar... nevertheless it was packaged, shipped and is displayed on shelves at the right eye level to lure dollars- all because of name recognition. We learned our lesson with George W. Bush, let's not relive it in the vein of cult music.  If only I had an Eraser, that I could wipe this disappointment from my memory"
1,"I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad."
5,"I can't believe someone would not enjoy this CD. My 2 kids ( ages 1 and 2 1/2) love this CD. Sometimes it is the only thing that will keep them happy. I will admit, if you are new to Laurie Berkner, it seems a little boring at first. But, after listening to it a couple of times, it is incredible. the words are so easy to learn and the tunes are catchy. I don't even mind if they are trapped in my head all day (unlike the other kid songs we have). We also have We Are the Dinosaurs, and love that one, too. I can't wait to get Laurie's other 2 CDs. I tell everyone about Laurie Berkner, she is a true gem"
1,"We all have different taste and I am trying to consider this. But to me this is just another artist who had a strange idea and we are bying it and help him to live a good life. Nickelodeon and even the Disney channel featuring him. My little girl and I listened to two songs that they played on the Disney channel over and over.Malti is the song she really started to listen to. Honestly. The only reason why that song is so great is Barbara's voice and singing ability. Dave can't sing and shouldn't even try to sing in Spanish. The tune is catchy and we find us humming along. SO I ordered this CD. What a joke. Most of the time you can't evne understand what he is saying and it is not as if he came up with new songs. He has the known children songs for the most part and just puts his own twist on it. But it is not entertaining for little ones.My daughter keeps asking: What is this? Till Malti comes on and then she and I are relieved and hum along with joy and glee. Thank you Barbara for saving this song. I even bought another CD thinking perhaps I just got a bad one and the next are better. I am disappointed with that one as well. So you take a song like Somewhere over the rainbow and put a new rythm on it. Wopee. I like it but it isn't worth it to me and I admit I have no idea or clue who this artist is and where he came from and what his background is but honestly.. he is overrated and sold. There is a song with Cheryl Crow on it. Okay. SO I am thinking this will be fun perhaps. Only to find that I want to shake him and her for again not putting some fun and step and pep into a song. I guess I am not a alternative and don't appreciate the earthy balance the musicians bring to the music. I want some rythm and clap your hands together and sing along type of music for my children. This type of stuff is something a teenager can appreicate later on only that the songs are too young for them at that time. My children have NO clue what this is about and can't figure it out. And we listen to everything from Disney to Classic, to Broadway. YOu name it. So we are not just Sesame Street CD lovers. But this music is a joke. No talent. ONE tone of voice and as if he forgets to open his teeth while singing. Barbar saves this CD but what a waste of money for ONE song. DON""T BUY IT. And all these people who fall for it.. grrrr. It is like a art gallerie. Everyone stands in front of the picture that shows a green dot. And they come up with tons of explanations what it may be and how fantastic the artist is. And in reality he is sitting back and chuckling because he just ran short of a painting and spilled his paint brush while cleaning it. Give me a break. Shame on Disney and Nickelodeon to fall into this as well. And taking out great singers and shorten real talents opportunity. WOw, guess you can tell I am not into it. ;0(  Explore, again.. everyone has different taste. But I just don't get it, nor like it. I find it horrible.   "
5,"this album good. me like very much.if you no like it, go f*** yourself. if you no like it, you suck more then me english. Actually, my english is not bad at all. This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell."
2,"I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put ""Low Rider"" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that"
5,the escalator and the man stand at the bottom summed up the album even before i had the pleasure of listening to such beauty and intelligence in my entire life time of listening to folk rock music this has affected me the most i can't tell how much..  i know it's an clinche but.it left me speechless i didn't know whether to cry jump up and down with merriment of..just sit quietly and seep in the beauty i had just been laid next too me.  all them emotions from a voice guitar and a trumpet at the end of broken arrows   how do you say can that happen? because this guy has talent. to transmit an beauty and vibrance over to the listeners ears  in my mind you have to be in tune with yourself to fully appreciate the album.    we all have these emotions in us to appreciate this album  on another level and i have and i won't be turning back it changed my life this afternoon.. the escalator only goes up..    
1,"One great ballad, Evermore Without You, doth not a musical make. That song is stunning, slightly pedestrian lyrics not withstanding. The rest of the show is simply dreadful. Some is downright irritating."" A secret, a secret....."", that line plays on the nerves like a rat gnawing on the fingernails. Horrible. I have a secret, stay away from this ridiculous mess. The plot is ludicrous, and the performances dull. They all sing it like they know how awful it is. And Michael Crawford has reached a new low in his mediocre career.  Hopefully someone like Barbara Cook or John Barrowman will record Evermore Without You, so the world can appreciatte it without having to go near this embarrassing trash.  Sir Andrew, c'mon, surely you can come up with something better than this"
1,"First off, Kanye West is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes. He looks plain, sounds plain, and if it wasn't for the controversy that surrounds him, everyone would be like ""Who Cares?"" But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music. Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today. His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about. So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy). So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's ""Nothing Left To Lose."" The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself"
1,"I'm a huge dylan fan - and collector  (I have around 120 or so of his albums, bootlegs, shows etc.). This is one of his worst ever - if not The worst - the only redeeming feature - the singing is not bad - even good on afew tracks. Docendo Discimus is dead right - spot on criticism - I could/t have said it better myself - so I won't try. anyone, IMH, who gives this album more than 3 stars is of his rocker.."
1,"One of the most ridiculous pieces of minimalist trash out there. It just goes to show you where a lot of time, a lot of money, popular culture, and a twisted world view have landed so much of American. Don't waste your time or your money on this."
2,"Not the best score I've ever heard. Certainly not bad, some tracks were very nice. Unfortunately, a good deal of them are too action-oriented for my liking, or simply boring. The best piece of music from the film, the beautifully haunting female chorus played over the spider pit scene (best part of the movie!), is sadly nowhere to be found on this disc. I don't doubt Howard's talent as a composer, but the music for King Kong, sadly, doesn't have the same bite as the movie."
5,"The first Band box-set, ""Across the Great Divide,"" was a disappointing ripoff, so this is long overdue.  And it's also worth the wait!  Others have criticized this set for having nothing completists won't already have.  I disagree.  I've been a serious Band fan for about a decade, and there are rarities on here that I'd never even heard of until now.  So for all but the hardest of hardcore fans, this is a welcome surprise.  Not perfect, but close enough.  If the accompanying book is correct, even the Band members themselves had forgotten about a couple of the previously unreleased tracks.  As for the rest of us, if there's a mid-60s recording you've heard of but never heard up to now, chances are it's here.  The 1964 single ""Uh Uh Uh""/""Leave Me Alone"" - which was considered ""lost"" a few years ago - is here, and it sounds terrific.  All three of the 1965 Atco sides are here (only one, ""He Don't Love You,"" was previously available on CD).  The studio recording of their cover of Bobby Blue Bland's ""Honky Tonk"" was an especially nice surprise for me; I'd heard an extremely low-fi live recording of it before but didn't know they'd ever officially recorded it.  There are a few surprises among their better-known work as well, notably the newly restored coda in ""To Kingdom Come.""    What is less satisfying is the selection of previously released tracks.  I know no box set is ever going to satisfy all of a given act's fans, but the previously-released portion of this set seems particularly haphazard, especially the recordings with Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan.  Where is ""High Blood Pressure,"" the only Hawkins single on which Robbie, Levon, Rick, Richard and Garth all played?  What about the myriad still-unreleased Basement Tapes that are rumored to exist?  (There are a few new releases from those sessions here, including a great early version of ""Caledonia Mission,"" but if the rumors are true it's still a drop in the bucket.)  And why does every Band best-of have to include the supremely overrated ""It Makes No Difference"" and omit the beautiful ""Hobo Jungle""?  Minor complaints, I concede, especially since anyone who likes the Band well enough to shell out for this collection will probably also have most or all of their original albums anyhow.  The DVD is a great addition as well, particularly the Saturday Night Live performances from just a few weeks before The Last Waltz.  Seeing the guys play together at that late date is almost surreal for those of us who know, er, the shape they were in, if you will.  If you want everything, this will get you close to it, at least"
4,"I have to confess that, while I love Clapton, his albums are often a hit-and-miss affair.  And I can't say I am a fan of the numerous recent blues tribute albums he has put out lately.  For me I enjoy his work with Cream, his guest work, his first few albums, the one he recorded with The Band, a few older live albums, and bits of the Phil Collins-produced record in the early 80s.  After that it's a fall-off, but I am thankful for all the great music he has turned out over the years.  I have been listening to 461 a lot lately.  It holds up exceedingly well.  The groove is laid-back, with solid musicianship and expert song selection.  It makes for great road music, especially ""Willie and the Hand Jive,"" ""I Shot the Sheriff,"" and the classic closer, ""Mainline Florida.""  The ballads are beautiful, too.  There is not a weak track on the album.  There is a consistent tone, an aversion to excess and a concentration on the note and harmonic ""fit"" that makes this album an overall winner in EC's catalog.  As someone who used to party in EC's old house at 461 Ocean Boulevard in Golden Beach in the early 80s, let me say -- you did it (and us) proud"
1,"32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad."
5,Like crackin open a cold beer. This is hip hop ya'll. This what needs to be on the airwaves. This whole album is listenable. No poppy fluff here. Just a dope MC paintin pictures with words and not videos. How dudes like JOC D4L and franchize boys sell records is still beyond me. Support real hip hop and buy this. You wont regret it
4,"Sheryl Crow has become one of my favorite artists. Several of my favorite songs appear on this album. Run, Baby Run opens the album in good form. Leaving Las Vegas is next. Strong Enough is probably my favorite song by Sheryl ever. I love the acoustic guitar. All I Wanna Do turned out to be a major hit for her and probably launched the career. I Shall Believe is another great song. This is a must for any fan of Sheryl Crows"
1,"As another person mentioned, I am no where near a bow bow hater. I remember feeling some type of way about liking him when he was younger because I seldom dig commercial rap. So now he's all grown up and doing his thing. He had a couple of hits.  One day I'm online reading about this guy hating on Will Smith and I later learned that this guy doesn't even write his own music. WHAT?!  Are you kidding me. No matter who the remarks was to, one cannot disrespect another rapper when they don't even write their own music. After hearing that I was just done. How can you rate his music when he is not writing it? What are we rating his sound over the music because he has no connection with it. I think it was just ok. ""Fresh as I am"" was hot. I was really feeling that sound. I like ok, he's all grown up and showing people what he is made up but again later I learned he didn't write it....lol..that'f funny. Is this how Jermain Dupri feels? Can the real rapper please stand up"
1,"Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, ""wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good."" Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified.   Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes.   However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke"
4,"I HAVE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME OUT IN 1973, AND ITS' STILL AS GOOD TODAY AS IT WAS BACK THEN. WOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY ARE A LOT OF REVIEWS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RECORD.IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM, IT'S NOT QUITE JAZZ, IT'S NOT QUITE ""FUNK"", IT'S NOT QUITE ""FUSION"" MUSIC, IT STANDS ON ITS' OWN AS SOMETHING ELSE.  KIND OF A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE.  AT THE TIME, KEYBOARD INNOVATIONS WERE REALLY COMING INTO VOGUE AND HERBIE REALLY KNEW HOW TO EXPLOIT IT ON THIS ALBUM.  BETTER THAN HIS LATER ELECTRONIC STUFF, WHICH WAS A LOT MORE COMMERCIAL.  OTHER CONTEMPORARIES FROM THIS TIME INCLUDE CHICK COREA, JAN HAMMER, GEORGE DUKE, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, STEVIE WONDER. "
4,"Boyz II Men made it huge in the 90s by pairing up their tight harmonies recalling classic Motown groups (Temps and Tops) with more up-to-date rhythmic tracks incorporating samples and other hip-hop stylings. This album broke them into superstardom as their followup to ""Cooleyhighharmony"", placing 4 songs into the charts for the Philadelphia group.   HIGHLIGHTS: This album pretty much divides into 2 'sides': The uptempo side (before ""Khalil"") and the ballads afterwards. Most of the biggest chart tunes fall in the 2nd half.  Part 1 has ""Thank You"" (the only up-tempo chart hit), an infectious number riding a Doug E. Fresh sample. ""Vibin'"" is a nice midtempo groove though the lyric's  pretty lightweight (We're just vibin'/dancin' the night away/Groovin'/Vibin'/non-stop until the break of day). ""I Sit Away"" is a Tony Rich tune about drowning in self pity that stops short of being maudlin. (This and ""Nobody Knows""..is Rich clinically depressed or what?)   In the ""slow side"", Babyface's ""I'll Make Love to you"" set a record for the length of time at #1. ""On Bended Knee"" (from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) and ""Water Runs Dry"" (another Babyface composition) also made some chart action. The group shows off their sterling harmonies on the Beatles classic ""Yesterday"" and they pull off the true feat of not embarrassing themselves on a rock classic. It's a wonderful rendition.  LOWS: ""All Around the World"" is Boyz II Men's rewrite of Ricky Nelson's ""Travelin' Man"" more or less, but not nearly as memorable. Considering how pivotal it is to the album, ""Khalil"" is a pretty blah track. ""Jezzebel"" is a dull overlong affair. ""50 Candles"" includes the lyric ""Holding your body like a plastic molding""....'nuff said.   BOTTOM LINE: There are enough hits to make this a mini-greatest hits all by itself, but the extras like ""I Sit By"" and ""Yesterday"" make this one worth owning. Recommended for R&B fans"
4,"With the founding father of R&B groups New Edition doing the solo thing in the early nineties and Boyz II Men still a year or so away, Troop was the premire R&B group of 1990. The songs Spread My Wings, All I Do Is Think Of You and I Will Always Love are some of the best songs to come out of early 90's R&B and the boys earned their spot in R&B in my opinion"
2,HE SOULD KEEP WRITING RYMES FOR OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE RBX AND THE WORK HE DOES WITH OTHERS BUT ON HIS OWN NOT SO GOO
5,"Michael Buble is phenomenal.  Song number 5 HOME is a choker-upper at our houses, but we all love it and sing it out loud.  Right now our family is separated by miles - but not for too much longer - the CD has tremendous sentimental value in our homes already and we will still be singing it I'm sure when we are all reunited again"
4,"The National Treasure soundtrack is one of my favorites. It's up-beat, and fast-paced, and very energetic. It has an interesting mix of orchestral, techno, and rock music - put together in a very creative way. It doesn't have many of those moments of miscillaneous chords wandering around everywhere like alot of soundtracks I've heard do. The only thing is that there are only a few themes and they are repeated a lot. So, listening to it TO much may get you tired of those themes pretty quickly. Other than that, I've REALLY enjoyed listening to it - and I highly reccommend it"
2,"The trouble with all-star tribute albums to past superstar artists and bands is that oftentimes they are done purely for money, attention, and a sense that certain of those artists can one-up the artists being paid the ""tribute"" to; and often, the results don't come close to measuring up to the originals.  Such, I'm afraid, is the case with the 1993 COMMON THREADS album, where Nashville artists give their props to that renegade bunch of desperados who occupied the Hotel California for most of the 1970s, the Eagles.  The brainchild of Eagles manager Irving Azoff, who saw how revered the band had become amongst the Nashville hierarchy of the Nineties, COMMON THREADS also functioned as a charity album, whose profits went to the Walden Woods Project, of which Eagles drummer Don Henley was a particularly prominent supporter.  Were it not for that one particular aspect, COMMON THREADS would be as much an aberration as a lot of other tribute albums of its type.  Even as this album already stands, however, and even though it caused hell to freeze over and the Eagles to reunite, the artists here still fall well short of what the band originally did.  What seems to have happened here is that each of the artists got so caught up in the idea of doing songs from the Eagles' massively successful catalog that they thought they could get off by copying almost note-for-note and by arrangement what the band had done; one listen to Travis Tritt's version of ""Take It Easy"", and Vince Gill's take on ""I Can't Tell You Why"" seems to indicate this.  In other cases, they sound terribly anemic, as in Clint Black's version of ""Desperado"", where he sounds like second-rate John Denver (and I think John Denver could have done this far better than Clint Black).  And hearing faux-Eagles wanna-bes like Little Texas doing ""Peaceful Easy Feeling"" and Diamond Rio doing ""Lyin' Eyes"" is no substitute whatsoever for the real thing.  The womenfolk don't have it much easier either.  Lorrie Morgan simply sounds out of place on ""The Sad Cafe"", seemingly not having any idea about the song's mournful inspiration; and Tanya Tucker's toughness on ""Already Gone"" is quite dull.  Suzy Bogguss' take on ""Take It To The Limit"" is a bit better, but it won't make anyone forget the Randy Meisner-led original. And Trisha Yearwood's version of ""New Kid In Town"" is okay, but she sounds like she's trying to do it the way she thinks her idol Linda Ronstadt would, and it's not totally successful either.  In the end, the inability of contemporary Nashville artists to really understand the Eagles lies in the fact that there is a very wide gap between the Eagles' sound of the 1970s and the way contemporary Music Row does things.  Though classified as ""country-rock"", the Eagles also mixed in elements of bluegrass, surf-rock, R&B, disco, and even Tex-Mex a time or two, styles that are largely alien to contemporary Nashville.  As Linda herself, around whom the Eagles originally formed in 1971, has said, it is a part of the diverse spectrum of California music: ""California music is a real hybrid, very specialized, and it doesn't have anything to do with Nashville.""  This is something that I'm not sure these artists really understand, and why I can't give this album a better rating"
2,"Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!"
1,"As if Toxicity wasnt mediocre enough, this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it. Where do we place the blame? Is it Darons poor songwriting skills? Or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible MTV-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up? Or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and TV?   Whichever one you choose, this is not the SOAD we all love, this is an unoriginal rehash of Toxicity. Oh wow, they have an anti-government song? So what, who hasnt made one of those. And anti-war songs? Travel back to the 60s, they were chock full full of them. Everything I hear is uninspired and downright lazy. Its also unfortunate that Serj got sidelined by Daron ""I wish I had talent"" Malakian, for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs, while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have ADHD in your classroom that are just seriously not funny.  Maybe im being to harsh, but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-Toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure, and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics.  You want to get good music, get SOAD's self titled, its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as MTV. "
5,"I have been addicted to this CD for months. I heard one of the songs on the NEW AGE satellite channel and thought I'd give the CD a chance. The entire CD is awesome. The music reminds me of Enigma, Deep Forest, and Medicine Woman (except no fruity bird sounds). Sure enough, as I checked out some stuff about Kevin Wood, it said his influences were: Enya, Patrick O'Hearn, Deep Forest, Sacred Spirit, Enigma, and George Winston. If you like the sounds of those musicians, you'll love this CD. The piano pieces are exceptional and every song has a good rhythm/beat. If you take a chance, ENJOY"
4,"What a shame. Such a good debut album yet no one even knows who they are. Jay Ferguson is one of the luckiest or most talented artists. He achieved success in 3 forms (Spirit, Jo Jo and Thunder Island solo). This is a great, gritty, greasy, soulful southern rock album.   I would like to see a modern band do a cover so as to resurrect this quality band. How about Metalica doing Run, run run?"
5,"I gladly sacrificed two of the four speakers in my car to this wonderful, wonderful treasure. What more can I say"
5,"My favorite song on this record is ""Subterranean Homesick Blues."" I keep picturing that video in my mind of a very young Bob Dylan, flipping those cards to the beat of this song. ""115th Dream"" is another song with those great lyrics that only Dylan can write. He is certainly a poet, there is no denying that. I Love it's Alright, Ma."" But every time I hear the version on this early record, my ears subconsciously hear all the the applause that you hear erupting during the live version on ""Before the Flood"" when Dylan shouts out, ""Sometimes even the President of the United States must have to stand naked."" That song worked then. It works now. We need a young troubador to help us find our way in these troubled times. But, I suppose nobody listened then, so I guess they wouldn't listen now. Still, I'd like a young Dylan today raging against all the injustice that abounds"
5,"I'M FROM FLORIDA AND DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD THAT MUCH TALENT HERE. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I BOUGHT A ALBUM THAT I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD SPENT 15 TO 20 DOLLARS TO HERE 1 SONG THAT I LIKED. I ROCKED T-PAIN'S ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END. RAPPA TERNT SANGA PROVES THE U DON'T HAVE TO STEAL, KILL, SELL DRUGS, HAVE SEX, OR BE THUGED OUT IN EVER SONG TO INTEREST PEOPLE. . ."
2,"Points for the concept, but this CD kept me awake!  The crashing waves are loud and distracting, even on low volume, and the music frankly a little depressing.  I actually found myself getting agitated listening to it.  Then again, I had some of the worst nights' sleep ever during a vacation in Belize in which I camped on the beach for a week.  Oddly enough, Gibson's Ocean Sounds works better for me, probably because there the waves are gently washing up on shore rather than smacking into rocks.  If you are used to ocean sounds then Natural Sleep Inducement may work for you, but if you're landlocked like me you may not find it as helpful"
1,this CD Deserves 1/2 a Star Because i did enjoy whipping it out the window of my car into a nearby bicyclist....It was pretty funny.  Otherwise this record was worthless
4,"I have been reading some of the reviews online for this CD and I am wondering for the P-Funk haters with the state of black music on the radio what do you people expect? I like this double CD because George was going for the old & new sound of today's overproduced and water down sound.The songs I really liked were ""Bounce 2 This"" a funk jam for the ages,""Inhale Slow"",""Never Ending Love"",""Su,Su,Su"",""Something Stank"",""Viagra"",""Paradigm"",""Gyspy Woman"",""Whole Lotta Shakin"",and ""Goodnight Sweetheart,Goodnight"".There were some songs I didn't care for songs like ""I Can Dance"" which went on for too long and ""Butt-a-Butt"".I wish Mr. Clinton would brought some of his trademark characters to this CD:Sir Nose,Starchild,Dr.Funkenstein,the monkey,The Horny Horns,etc.In short,this is a very good album better than the pervious P-Funk albums in the 90's.This CD is a good start"
5,"Ever walk around, read the newspaper, watch TV, and basically see so mch stupid stuff that it takes all your willpower not to go off and bash everything? Thankfully, Black doesn't care whose feelings get hurt, so we're all benefitting from it. Hilarious stuff, man.."
1,"is this a cover of Social D's sick boy?  and if youre looking for a good album, get one of theirs"
1,Turns out I purchased this cd for one song.  I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd.  The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd
5,"If you've never bought a Country CD in your life, Make this your first. It is haunting. I defy anyone to play this just once. I always repeat it at least 3 times.    The Man is the most potent proof that one can reveal the age of one's soul through his music. As flat & shallow as the most electronically plumped pop crap on the so called country charts today, is Hank Williams III deep. Next to III, His Father may as well be a fat drunk in a seedy karaoke bar. This young man does his Grandpa proud & them some. He seems possessed of the spirit without having to struggle to invent an identity of his own like his father before him to step out of big Hank's shadow. III steps into the shadow and lights it up like a state fair on the 4th of July. It is all there. It has skipped a generation but it is in the marrow of his bones. In fact he's a damn good living argument for re-incarnation if you ask me. Haunting is a word that is in my mind every time I play my copy of one of his albums. But this isn't for someone looking for a fair impression of Grandpa as his father once did. I myself find myself listening to III then putting on a bit of Grandpa & after a few songs I'm hungry for this all together new phenomenon. The dimensions he reveals & the music he creates in doing so. It's not old fashioned country, nor rockabilly, punk, rock or anything that I think can be pigeon holed. It is as new a form as the bop with which Charlie Parker once rocked the Jazz world. Hank III's versatility is beyond description. Surrounding himself with a posse of daredevil side men who are as hot, versatile & inventive as he, Hank III will have you banging on the Internet for more discs & cursing his woebegone label for holding him back. So talented & so obviously deep a well of humanity is this young man that it would come as no surprise to me if someone, someday mined a great acting ability from that well. The distant mournful look in his eyes within the innocent childlike face belies any image of less to which any reviewer of poorer soul may point.   He is at once, dark, mournful, childishly cocky, sexy, raw & miscieveouly playful. He has a facet for every emotion a listener can possibly need expressed through music. You will put him on when you're blue and end up cheered, you will put him on for a good time & end up haunted long after the album has reached it's end. He comes across as the kind of guy with whom any fun loving man would like to roll one, go out & get plastered & any woman would want to hole up for a stormy few days in shack with a guitar & couple of bottles of J.D.   I pray he can get by & be happy without ever selling out to the industry & falling into the same crap mold of all the big Nashville/Hollywood stars who pass for country artists today. Listen to this Boy & every country record, tape or cd you own that isn't his, his Grandfather's or Patsy Cline's will gather a thick layer of dust before you put them in a giveaway box where they belong. He will surely leave you with an allergy to sequins sharp black suits and Grammy winning, bleached white teeth.   There was Hank Williams & There is HANK WILLIAMS III. Don't need nobody else & if ya do, you must have a tin ear, shallow life, black heart and a deep dark hole where your soul oughtta be.   Hank Williams JR. -- Do yourself a favor old man & retire. He has come -- no thanks to you!"
5,I love this album.. every track fits perfectly.. this is good hip-hop the way that it's supposed to be done. I don't know which track I would consider my favorite since overall I like every one but I would say that the beat to T.R.O.Y is just plain out awesome one of my favorites of all time.

4,"This is a very enjoyable hip-hop album that was a breath of fresh air when it sppeared. Although it lacks a super-duper classic tune, it is strong on 90 percent of the songs. The only problem for the artists who recorded the album is, it is so good, there isn't anything else to say at the end. How can Pete Rock and CL Smooth do any better? This is their 'Invisible Man' so it did not shock me that they did not record much after the release of this gem. CL Smooth appears to improvise at times on this album and doesn't sound rehearsed (much rap does). Pete Rock's beats are superb. Don't waste your money on sex rap or crime rap; get this one, and learn"
1,"Who keeps coming out with these CD's? Who is crazy, stupid, retarted, and idiotic enough to make so many Kidz Bops!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? They KILLED My Immortal which is my absolute FAVORITE song that was ever written on the face of this earth!!!!!!!! The adult who sings the leads on Toxic sounds like somebody's grandmother being eaten by giant mutated brocolli. I'm serious--and I don't even like Britney Spears. Who is buying this crap?  THE TERROR MUST STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"What a change for Bob Dylan. First he was a folk singer, than a hard rocker and now it seems he'd turned direction, going a bit country. However, don't make any mistake, just because he's got country musicians, this is still a rocker and it's one of my top five favorite Dylan records. ""John Wesley Harding"" is sort of a western ballad that will have you stamping your feet. ""As I Went Out One Morning"" is a country rocker with a message. So are many of the other songs on this record"
1,"First of all, I want to make clear that I think this is a phenomenal, 5-star album.  This review is for the remastered edition of the cd only.  If you already have the original cd release of this, hold on to it.  That one has problems, but it at least sounds true to the original album.  This remaster is an atrocity.  The drums dominate the mix (sorry Cozy -- I don't love you THAT much), while the vocals float in the background.  Worst of all, you have to strain to hear the guitar in many parts, with the synthesizer far more prominent.  Whoever remixed this is an idiot.  Evidently, they think that Ritchie Blackmore was the LEAST important person in this band.  I assume that most Rainbow fans would disagree--with no disrespect to the rest of this legendary lineup.  Rainbow Rising is classic rock for people who enjoy guitar, not nu-metal for people who want to demo their subwoofers.  It should have been mixed that way.  Beyond the sound of it, all these Rainbow remastered re-issues are a rip-off in every other way, as well.  No liner notes.  No lyrics.  No bonus tracks (not even the inclusion of ""Jealous Lover"" with Difficult to Cure, which was on a cd single at the time of the album's release).  These re-issues are the worst I've seen from any band.  Compare them to the Deep Purple anniversary remasters and it becomes obvious how much more could have been done with these.  In my opinion, this is an insult to the diehard fans who are purchasing these releases for the third or fourth time (lp, first cd release, Japan import cd, and newly ""remastered"" version).  If you don't have this yet, you should buy any version you can find as quickly as possible, because you've been missing out.  But for anyone who already has a previous release of this cd, you should just save your money"
5,"As a musician, I find &quot;Not Guilty&quot; to be of a very high standard, musically. Calvin Rodgers is awesome and unmatched on the drums. The musicians kept the Groove in the pocket. This is a very professionally done project and it is an example of a &quot;More excellent way&quot; of ministering the Gospel in today's world.I listen to the CD daily. Who said that we cannot play Jazz, R&amp;B, Rap, Hip Hop etc etc? Yes, &quot;IT'S POSSIBLE&quot; but the difference here is The Anointing; Lyrics to point folks to Jesus, and Music, saturated with the God kinda vibe played in the vernacular of the man on the street. Pastor Kee, you are a trend setter. Keep up the good work. So Folks, go out there and purchase a copy today. It will change your life"
2,The first song is okay... the rest are incredible boring. This album is completely unoriginal. I regret buying it.
1,"Have U heard ""let's go"" from from this poser who thinks nobody has ever heard crazy train from ozzy osbourne? He completely killed a really cool part of that song and replaced a really hardcore song with somthing dumb like ""Let's Go!!!!!"" and other dumb rhymes. I never understood why rap did this. Think of me as white heavy metal trash if U want but at least heavy metal people play guitar and rappers use mics and rap about things nobody cares about. Heavy metal people are experienced with their fingers while rappers like Trick Daddy use their palms (think about that for a minute) now if U like trick daddy I have no problem with that. I would also have no problem if they did a cover for crazy train from ozzy but I get pissed if they start ripping off giutar riffs from him. I'm more of a heavy metal type of guy but I like SOME rap. Listen to Eminem, Ludicris, or Lil'John if U wanna hear some rap with original Ideas"
2,"Although I do not agree with the message this CD is trying to get across, I will say the music is great. I think Rock Stars/Celebrities should quit pushing their views on easily persuaded 16 year olds who think of Rock stars as idols. It seems people in this world don't make up their own mind anymore, instead they are manipulated by the ""Loud-Mouth Minority."" Get your facts straight, but in the meantime, enjoy the great music. 2 stars for good music, missing 3 stars for the stupid message they are pushing forward"
5,"I have a very special care for this Vivaldi's work.  Somehow, life has made me aware of many forms of interpretation of this very concert. Yesterday I was listening to it and I was aware of some details that made me look for it.  I simply knew that the director was asking for wonderful new sounds that are not often to be found in the average performance of this masterwork.  Often, my favourite version is the one of ""I Musici"". Yet I wasn't too surprised to find it was Osawa the conducer of this amazing version.  I had had the chance of listening to previous works by him and I realize how he manages to make a classical always present.  If he is the director of this record, no doubt, it is worthwile"
5,"A few points about the bad reviews sitting in here...  Master Shake shurrup you should be slapped about the room!!!  Mathew Braxmeier --- Generic Emo??? I bet you have never listened to Emo in your life man... Clueless Whiner!!! And as for a title lenght... What would you preffer? Something short n catchy for you like 'Wannabe' By the Spicegirls??? Did you buy the album or just search for sum bands you probably knew you wouldnt like so that u could moan about em???  And as for Jane Doe --- HHHMMMM there is the 'old favourite' Nirvana... WOW that would be amazing for sumbody to not like Nirvana thesedays... Granted they did write a few good songs... Heck even spawned Foo Fighters after the death but jesus samuel christ!!! Ive yet to meet sumbody thats not in love with them...  And before you sit there and say... Aw i bet he hasnt heard anything other than smells like teen spirit and come as you are... Wrong! I have every album... I just choose not to listen to them to fall under the typical Category of Anotherone who goes with the crowd...  As for Black Flag, Sex Pistols and The misfits... Wow a little bit of taste from someone who has yet to have a little bit of variation in her taste!!! Move with the times Jane... All great bands in their time just as Fall Out is a brilliant band of this time!!!  Every song just as catchy as the next with this album... Yet to hear how they can sound the same as AFI, Greenday or Panic!  Anyone who wants to whine send them my way... Im sure Jane will i noticed the only 2 reviews were complete and utter moans...   Buy this album... It is sheer genius!!!  At the same time check out these bands guys...  - Hoobastank (New album out) - Jimmy Eat World - Stiff Little Fingers (Amazing Punk band from late 70's still going at the moment and touring soon) - Flogging Molly (Irish Punk) - Three Days Grace - American Hi-Fi (New Album) - Yellowcard (Amazin Band) - Papa Roach (Still Going Strong) - Panic! At The Disco - 3 Doors Dow"
1,"I've been down for Monica since the beginning; but now I am FINISHED, I love Monica's voice, but whats up with all these singers wanting to be rappers...WTF!!! I want the soulfoul Monica from the first CD, ""Sideline Ho"" ARE YOU SERIOUS!!! again WTF!! Could someone please come out with a soulful mature CD, cause this one aint even close."
1,"How did this guy ever get a recording contract? Not only is his singing style shmaltzy, but his voice is grating, whiney, and nasally. Besides being a self-admitted atheist and homosexual, he is a terrible singer. Very handsome, though. He looks like a cross between a giant mosquito and a Kangaroo who got into somebody's eye shadow and makeup kits. What an overrated wierdo. This guy had to have friends inside the industry. Manilow singing Tony Bennett or Bobby Darin is akin to Cedric the Entertainer playing Cary Grant or Clark Gable. In drag, no less"
4,"""Hits"" is a collection of 16 songs from Phil Collins solo career, from 1981-1998. I'm a big fan of Genesis (both Phil Collins' and Peter Gabriel's), and Phil's ""Groovy Kind of Love"" was playing on the way home on my first day of school, so I'll always have a soft spot for this collection, and though it's missing and has room for a couple of the hits I would have liked (like ""Don't Lose My Number"") I have gone through a couple of copies of this one.  Phil really has a warmth and honesty to his love songs that's pretty unique. His earthy voice, matched with the particular production he prefers, captures and evokes the 1980s pretty well too. That's not to say he's just 1980s ballads. He also sings of contemporary issues like in ""Another Day In Paradise"" and ""Both Sides of the Story"", and does interesting descriptions of character in songs like ""In The Air Tonight"" and ""Take Me Home"". There's a good mix of all that here. Phil's voice can get pretty powerful, on ""I Wish It Could Rain Down"" for intance. He'd come a long way from quietly singing ""For Absent Friends"" (one of his first recorded songs, featured on the 1971 Genesis album ""Nursery Cryme"").  He's a great drummer too, always had been, and even then he's not afraid to play around with a drum machine, which were seen to some as a bit threatening in the 1980s, from what I've read.  The bonus track on ""Hits"" is a version of Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colours"", with some backing vocals by Babyface. It's pretty laid back, fits in with the hits, and I'm glad to have it. The booklet folds out into a mini-poster with the vague impressions of his solo album covers (as painted on this CD art) on it. On the other side, there are credits for all the songs, which were interesting. I had no idea both Sting and Phil's old friend Peter Gabriel do backup vocals of ""Take Me Home"", and I wouldn't have known unless I read it here.  There's a 2 CD Phil Collins compilation out there called ""Love Songs"", and while there's some good tracks, and some interesting bonus and live stuff on it, it's all slower and sentimental, and doesn't really show off Phil's versatility as well as ""Hits"". Plus, with this compilation, there are songs from soundtracks and non-Phil Collins albums (like ""Buster"", ""Chinese Wall"", etc) that you won't have to go hunting round for, as they're all here in one place.  Genesis' ""Turn it On Again: The Hits"" would go well with this one, as it has Phil's other hits like ""Invisble Touch"", ""I Can't Dance"" and ""Follow You, Follow Me"". Recommended. Four and a half stars"
2,"I really enjoyed the first two books albums, I bought Thought for Food almost immediately after the Lemon of Pink because I enjoyed it so much. I found their sound to be quite original with an interesting balance of emotion and humor along with the balance between electronic and acoustic music. So I was really disappointed when I heard their new album. This record is clearly intended to be their breakthrough, with far more vocals and regular song structure and less expirementalism. The record even reuses some samples from old albums which was really annoying. This album lacks the interesting, unexpected twists from their previous works, and as a result comes off as generally bland and sometimes even cheesy. If you want a Books album, please check out the other two first"
1,"they said the cd was new. that it was still in its shrink wrap and everything. instead, they sent me an old, delaphadated and used cd.  it had many scratches on it, and one of the tracks wouldnt even play"
2,"I've been a Beastie Boys fan since I was in 8 years old. I played the cassette version of License to Ill until it did nothing but make a squealing sound in my head phones. And until a while ago I would maintain to anyone that EVERY Beastie Boys album was great, cool in its own right and an evolutionary step forward by some of hip hop's most talented artists. (Get to the point. I know, I know.) But I had never really owned ""Hello Nasty' myself. It was the only one of their albums I hadn't picked upon release. Until recently.  Now, upon closer inspection reveals that there really isn't a stand out track on the whole album. ""Intergalactic,"" ""Body Movin'"" and ""Super Disco Breakin'"" may have been pseudo hits but they don't really stand out from the rest of the album, which feels like mostly filler. Decent filler, though. There are a few stinkers: ""Song for the Man"" (It's cool when they try to do new things and the lyrics are interesting, but this track is utterly skippable) and Dedication (following House of Pain's shout out track lead is indulgent and just plain boring to listen to).  Like their previous two LPs, there are a few decent instrumental track that break up the album. But in general the whole album seems to pass unnoticed. I listened to it 4 times in a row while at work an couldn't really discern any standout track. But for what it's worth, I wasn't annoyed.   All in all it's cool to hear the B-Boys make a cohesive album with a unique sound, but it's not mind blowing. I'd recommend it for serious fans and people collecting all their CDs. It's certainly won't detract from your collection and there will be a time you'll want to listen to it. But I wouldn't expect to find yourself picking it over Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head or even To The 5 Boroughs (awesome, by the way) for that matter."

1,"Let me start off by saying that after extensive therapy, I feel that I'm finally able to write this review.  I've been reading some of the other comments on this board and all I can say is that I've never been an advocate of hindering people's right to free speech...until now.  I just got finished listening to Jeffery Gaines's version of In Your Eyes and I have two burning questions that just won't go away.  First of all, where is it that the other contributors to this board buy their smoke?  And secondly, why didn't Mr. Gaines just cover Peter Gabriel in gasoline, strike a match, and call it even?  On the other hand, I must agree with a few of these people on one point: this version of In Your Eyes evokes emotions in me I never thought I had the capacity to realize.  I honestly can't say I blame anyone who finds their eyes welling up with tears when confronted with this towering monument to mediocrity--I had the same experience myself.  And as for those wisened souls who feel this version has some measure of value and, in fact, &quot;blows Peter Gabriel's version out of the water,&quot; here's a thought for you to tax your proton-sized brains over: a nuclear bomb can blow many things out of the water, but that doesn't make it a good thing to inflict on innocent people.  But if, after considering this, you still arrive at your original conclusion, there's only one course of action I can self-respectingly recommend. Take your own life.  Do it now before it's too late"
5,"that you will discover them very soon - buy this disc!  Seriously, I had vinyl of both of these releases in college and as CD's took over replaced my vinyl with this.  It's pure psychedelic power pop done right, combining sing along hook happy elements of the Beatles, ethereal layered guitar work with background electronics that really put it ""out there"".  Front man Mitch Easter of course played a hand in putting REM at the forefront of college radio and it's unfortunate that his excellent work with Let's Active never really made it into the mainstream consciousness.  Those who have heard it know.  Buy this, love it, and then move on to Big Plans for Everybody"
1,"In today's rap market the hot commodities are the albums that have the most materialism, disrespect to women, and ""gangsta fairytales"". Well Shawnna's album has all of the above and her sales are poor. So what does that say for Shawnna. She can't even sell in a market that caters to commercial BS!!!!!! This album is garbage, Shawnna is chi-town garbage and needs to find a new occupation. I suggest her finding either the nearest strip club (since she is from the chi I suggest Arnie's in Harvey!) or find the nearest porn studio for a more productive career"
5,"This is a very good dance album with amazing lyrics and beats! i remeber when i first saw the ""Dancing Queen"" video on Disney Channel when i was in 5th grade and i was truly captivated by them!

After these seven songs the album just gets pretty lame. BUT TRUST ME- THESE SONGS ARE WORTH IT  Final Grade-9/10    "
1,"This record blowz. The tunes last forever -- one verse after another, same crap melody over and over, no drama, no nothing except the old ennui, which I guess is what appeals to some folks. And Lenny couldn't manage to sing in tune for more than three consecutive notes. He's improved somewhat over the years, but you all really need too look up from your ""Fleurs de Mal"" once in awhile. Poetry is poetry, music is music, and while Leonard's poetry may speak to you, his music sucks"
1,"I've always thought of Diana Krall as a sellout. I've been told that she was not a singer by choice, that record execs saw dollar signs and ""encouraged"" this mediocre pianist to sing. They were lucky that Krall has a nice voice quality and sings in tune, and can swing in a very middle of the road, 2 levels above white bread kind of way. But as a performer, she comes off as an emotionless robot. Her overall delivery is a droning monotone. Every song is performed the same way, in a husky, lilting, and ultimately boring as hell manner.  Since Norah Jones has effectively blown Krall out of the water in terms of sales, what could they think of as a comeback? How bout a Christmas album! Nothing says sellout like Christmas. And I actually like some of those songs, but to be honest, I'd rather sit around and sing them with my friends than listen to Krall sleepwalk through this set of traditional tunes. In fact, I'd rather go Christmas Caroling in the Gaza Strip than listen to this unimaginative, boring, lifeless collection of performances.  OK, maybe I'm being too harsh. But once a tool, always a tool. Krall is too much part of the machine, so if she did have an original idea, I doubt there would be anyone in the company that would let her try it.  Some the arrangements on this disc have nice orchestration, but overall sound very functional, commercial, and bland. Which fit perfectly with Krall's bland delivery. Even when she tries to emote on Mel Torme's great composition "" The Christmas Song"", it sounds disingenuine.  I think of Diana Krall as a product. When a business school grad goes to work at a corporation, they come in with profit as their goal. So whatever product they want to market and sell to the American public, and hopefully the World market, they want to have the most widespread appeal possible. Diana Krall is the Coca Cola Sugar Water of music. Sugary Sweet, a buxom blond with very little nutrition or substance in her artistry. But the vast public wants a CD, i mean, product, that they can put on at a dinner party and basically talk over and say, "" We love jazz! Here's our Diana Krall CD."" Diana's pose on the front cover says it all. Pretty and all dressed up but just lays there lifeless. It's almost a pose of defeat. Even sellouts have their limits"
1,"I was very disappointed in this CD.  I like her and have been a fan for years.  I think the piano accompaniment didn't do her justice either.  I listened to half and couldn't be bothered to finish the rest.  I was so disappointed, especially since I had read such good reviews of it"

4,"We had already seen an album with Hip Hop infleunts on ""Diamonds and Pearls"" from 1991, this album from 1992 commonly called The Symbol or just Prince & The Power Generation is the album where it eventually sounds like a band performing together, and not a semi-solo album like ""Diamonds"". They also go one level further with even more hip hop sound then on any other album.  ""My Name is Prince"" samples his old song ""I Wanna Be Your Lover"" among others in the beginning, the song itself is a catchy hip hop infleunted song with both raps and samples. Prince also raps here and he's loud as even before. With lyrics such as ""My name is Prince and I am funky,My name is Prince the one and only"" it may sound ego-centric but with all the things he's done and experienced he got the right to.   ""Sexy M.F"" was a song that the radio didn't want to play cause of it's explicit lyrics and (title aswell). On MTV is became a massive hit but it was highly censored. It feaurures guitars and classic horns. ""Love 2 the 9's"" is a middle paced slow jam, still with hip hop sound though. ""Morning Papers"" is anothe ballad, but more relaxed. Great lyrics like ""If he poured his heart into a glass, And offered it like wine ,She could drink and be back in time for the morning papers"". ""The Max"" is a funky hip hopish number where NPG show it's potential. ""Blue Light"" is a slow paced song with reggae sound somehow. ""Eye Wanna Melt With U"" Is also funky explicit song about sex. ""Sweet Baby"" is the opposite, a very emotional ballad about love.  ""Continental"" is a up-tempo song with horns where NPG once again show what they got. ""Damn U"" is a slow trendy ballad. ""Arrogance"" is only 1.35, and sound more like a funny number then anything serious. ""The Flow"" is also a funky song that feaurueres horns, pretty typical for this album. ""7"" was one of the biggest hits from this album, a middle tempo odd number that does't really fit in here. ""All 7 and we'll watch them fall, They stand in the way of love, and we will smoke them all, With an intellect and a savoir-faire"" It's aparently about a man from the bible that will never grow old. Ditto with ""And God Created Woman"", a beautiful ballad perfectly suited for a Prince album. ""3 Chains of Gold"" is midtempo mini-opera that goes on for over 6 minutes, it's part soulish falsetto and part guitar solo's. Very Unique. ""Sacrifice of Victor"" is a funky song that portrait Prince as a civil rights activist and goes back discussing the riots after Martin Luther King Jr's death.  Overall, this album is much more focused then the last one and here most songs are either funky hip hop sounding ot smooth ballds. It doesn't feel like a solo album anymore and NPG get's much more space then on any other album. The lyrics are exceptionally on point here and the rock opera on ""3 Chains of Gold"" is one not to miss. Although it was messy There were more natural hit singles in ""Diamonds"" though and this ""Symbol"" album get's a little repetitive at times, on the other hand it's proves that Prince was able to melt into the early 90's hip hop revolution and do it with class. 4/"
1,"I was very eager to buy this CD. I have the CD Elixir and I love it. I saw and heard fourplay in Atlanta and they were awesome. However, this CD has too much computerized music. Too many sythensized voices. Very predictable. In my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. I didn't care for this one at all"
4,"A dream is what your heart makes. And for years we've been dreaming and wishing that Cinderella would make a comeback. And thanks to the magic of Disney, our wish has been granted. (Please do not mix up this Cinderella with the punk-rock band of the same name. This is music; that is a mess.) We are happy to see (and hear) that extra tracks, including two demo recordings. And though we understand Disney's marketing techniques, we do wish that the added performances by Jim Brickman and Kimberely Locke would go away. Maybe if we close our eyes real tight and chant those three magic words. All together now: bibbidi-bobbidi-boo .."
4,"When your drowning in the world of trendy, here today, gone tomorrow rappers... Murs is a breath of fresh air.  I like every track on this album, as well as 3:16.  Usually I pick up an album, like a few tracks, and listen to the dope tracks and that's it.  I wish it were a little longer, or contained a few more tracks.   Still a dope album though"
2,"Just like the Beatles, Led Zeppelin in most peoples eyes can do no wrong. Sorry they can and this along with 'in through the outdoor' is a band so full of self importance that they can serve up drivel like this and go platinum. I mean if any other band served up psuedo raggae(d'yer maker), a funk James Brown catastrophe (the crunge), half finished songs (dancing days, the ocean)and a complete mish mash of ideas (song remains the same) it would be career suicide, not Zeppelin though. I find their arrogance on this quite breathtaking. Sure 'no quater' and 'over the hills' are great, but Jesus doesn't Plants warblings and hippy drippy lyrics grate after a while. Mind you he never was that great when compared with say Paul Rogers or Ian Gillan. The only saving grace with this is one of the greatest cover designs ever"

5,"I was laughing hysterically when I read Dicks review of John Lennon, I looked at the other things he reviewed - aprox. 10 albums, and he was bitching about them all, gave them all one star, so the only albums he reviewed were the ones he disliked....oh yeah except for the BEEGEE's, he likes them. lol So forget peace and love and understanding- its all jive talking.

1,"Imagine no possessions?  Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces.  Imagine no religion?  Fine, if religion's such a ""crutch"", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit.  Imagine no countries?  Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador.  The world will be as one?  Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most.  John Lennon was a text book phony.  He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't.  Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now.  The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation.  His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn.  Thank you very much.  -DW. "
4,"I'm a recording engineer by trade.  I sit in little rooms with no windows and big speakers listening to the same song for 15 hour stretches for weeks in a row.  Every now and again a record will roll through that is actually fun to make.  This sounds like one of those recordings.  Whether or not the players took this seriously or not will only be known to them and the production team, but the presentation comes across as if it was just a bunch of talented friends hanging around a studio and having some fun making music.    With a great cover version of one of my absolute favorite Hank songs, the album might have been able to leave one or two songs in the can... but rip the album to an iPod and those songs can be the right breath of fresh air as you're driving.  The audio quality and production decisions of the recording should also be noted.  Yeah, there are some notes of questionable tuning but the their presentation is so believable the record would not have been served if those notes had been corrected.  Matt Marinelli captured the sounds with perfection, and didn't over process or manipulate it later [or so it seems!!].  The record works for me in a big way and I for one am exceptionally happy to own a copy of this recording [a client for whom I'm going to start a project in a few months sent me the copy as a kind of template for the way he'd like his project to come out... if we get 1/2 way there then that is going to be one damn fun project!!]"

2,"This is an okay compilation however its far from the best. If your looking for good punk music you wont find much of it here. Heres a list of the bands i thought were pretty good  The Offspring  Pennywise  Strung Out  Strike Anywhere  MxPx  Millencoln  No Use For A Name  Street Dogs  Plain White T's  I really hate emo music, And it's not like a really really hate all screamo/hardcore music its just that i really don't wanna hear like 40 songs in arow of it it almost sounds the same.  Hopfully next year there will be some more punkish bands on the tour such as Propagandhi, Nofx, Desendendents,Pennywise, Rise Against, Black Flag, Anti-Flag...et"
4,"This soundtrack is a mix.  My favorite songs are some of the prototype 80's tracks: Danger Zone, Mighty Wings, & Through the Fire.  But it also has some great oldies like Dock of the Bay & Great Balls of Fire.  If you haven't seen this movie yet then go out and rent it.  Then pick up a copy of the soundtrack"
5,"I have owned this CD since the day it came out and I have not stopped listening to it.  I like all rap and hip-hop for the most part.  I love lyric, social driven rap like The Roots and Talib Kweli and Mos Def, but I also have no problem throwing crunk club ish in the deck like Three Six Mafia or Lil' Jon.  That said, this album completely blows me away and it seriously pains me that Obie Trice is so slept on.  This album is better than Second Round's On Me, most likely because he had more help from Em on this one truthfully, but still, both CDs are great.  I just wanted to write this review to do something to try to spread the word.  This CD is unbelievable.  My three favorite rap CDs of all time are the Notorious BIG- Life After Death, Eminem- The Eminem Show, & Obie Trice- Cheers.  I love the female-problem-driven songs on here like Lady, Hands On Me, & even Don't Come Down about his mama.  The lyrics are unreal and his style is unprecedented and fresh.  He is creative, witty, and his flow is downright cold, not to mention production is superb.  Please buy this CD"
5,"Profondo Rosso is probably Goblin's finest hour in the soundtrack department, though I think many would debate that Suspiria and Zombi might be a little better.  I won't go into the music, coz I can't imagine someone buying this cd who's unfamiliar with the film and the music from the film.  You do get your money's worth, this sucker is 72 minutes long.  My only complaint with this, and all the other Goblin soundtracks is that there are about eight billion different versions of the same song.  I know people like this, but to me it gets a little irritating.  The alternate versions aren't really all that different from one another(with a few exceptions)-at least not different enough to want to hear the song again when you just heard it one or two tracks ago.  I mean, do we really need that many versions of the lullaby song?  But on the other hand, I do respect the fact that Cinevox went out of their way to make this as complete as possible.  And considering you have to take out a loan to pay for these soundtracks, it doesn't seem so bad in the end.  What it really comes down to is-If you like the music when you watch the film, then you'll like this cd"
1,"I honestly hate Kidz Bop. I mean, Avril Lavigne is my favorite singer, and My Happy Ending is too good of a song to be wrecked by Kidz Bop. I mean, I sing in the shower better then these kids! Don't buy it. Borrow it from the library if you must."
1,I bought this album on pure speculation it was an Amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me. Owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps. I had never listened to either of these guys. Read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture. Received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me. Wrong! This is one of the few albums I own that nails you right out of the box! It has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.The first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work. Smooth like a well aged whiskey. The final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces I've ever heard. It's one of the few pieces I know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too. All and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing. All in the way classical music does. I'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap! This is a real guitar players record
5,"BUY THIS ALBUM! Seriously, this is one amazing cd. Every single song on this cd is worthy of your purchase. I promise you will not be dissapointed"
5,"Man, this is a great record it moves and grooves and just suits you like a long motorcycle drive or a nice fitting glove.  Just kidding I don't ride motorcycles, but this music just makes me dance crazy with a pocketful full of soul.  It can't be helped how it revs the motor of your mind to jump on a motorcycle but the music is your engine, moving along the road and laughing the whole way cause the ride's fast and nothing stops it till you crash or run out of gas"
5,"I grew up on Dylan... in fact, Dylan is my middle name.  I was very intimate with his songs from a very early age.  When I bought this album in the early '90s, I was still in high school.  At first, I remember thinking that his voice was gone.  I didn't think I could listen to the entire album.  I struggled through it and put it on a shelf.    From time to time, I forced myself to listen to it.  I don't know exactly when the change took place... I suppose I grew up a bit, musically.  Good As I Been To You started to take shape.  The guitar... the harp... the voice.  All of a sudden, it meant something entirely different.  It made sense.  It all came together.    Now, fourteen years later, I listen to this album at least once a week.  I will not hesitate to say that this is a great album.  But, for some reason, it needs to grow on you.  It builds up to some subtle crescendo.  Then, suddenly, it will hit you like a ton of bricks.  Dylan knew exactly what he was doing.  This is his re-entry into greatness after a few years astray.  The guitar picking is incredible.  His voice couldn't be more appropriate for the content.  If you need more proof, just look at what the (rare) vinyl form of this album can fetch.  I recently acquired the LP, and it is the most expensive one in my collection!  Those 'in the know' really know what this album is worth.  Give it a try... then try it again.  Let the guitar flow through you for a while.  Sing along.  Go ahead and try.  It's not that easy.  You'll soom see why this IS one of Dylan's greatest albums.  I say that as a hard-core Dylan fan, so don't take it lightly"
5,"I bought this album because of the opening track, ""The Hollow,"" which, after listening to it online, I felt as if it was the most incredibly melodic rock song I've heard in a long time.  I also thought Maynard's voice sounded absolutely amazing on that song.    So I went out a bought the album about an hour ago, literally!  Every song is amazing!  Even though many of the songs are heavy, they have this highly ambient melodic feel to them, especially with Billy Howerdel's and Troy Van Leeuwen's guitar playing, which really shine all the way through on the album.  They use some very interesting guitar effects for virtually every song.    In any event, whether you are a fan of Tool or not, a fan of Maynard's or not, BUY THIS ALBUM!  I'll admit, I'm a fan of Tool, no doubt, especially the albums ""Aenima,"" and ""Lateralus,"" which both have some of the most incredible progressive metal music on them, but I almost like this band better.  I like the fact that APC is just about as heavy as Tool, more melodic, have a more polished sound, are more experimental and progressive (in my opinion) than most of what I've heard from Tool.  This is not to discredit Tool's work, of course, whose music has already been etched in the alms of metal and hard rock history, it is just to say that APC is another alternative.  Whether or not this is a ""side project"" of Maynard's or not, it does not matter to me, the band and album is flipping amazing in every which way!  FAVORITE SONGS: ""THE HOLLOW,"" ""ORESTES,"" and ""3 Libras"".  "
5,"Unbelievable songwriting! How could TJW go relatively unnoticed as he has been in the music industry? I just saw him in Los Angeles last week in a smaller venue and he tore the roof off the place!!! Just him, his Stratocaster & harmonica and a drummer. With the PA system set up right he sounded like a 5-piece band with just the 2 of them! One Hot July is probably his best effort to date in my opinion and now I'm currently in the process of purchasing everything he's ever put out!!! Buy this album and experience some of the best music ever produced"
1,"The CARS were one of the most annoying, dumb, pathetic, lame, overrated, stupid, lousy, and awful bands ever came out in the 70's. Their lead singer RIC OCASEK sings horribly and sings like a baby. This greatest-hits album was a huge joke that each and every song is incredibly bad.  Their guitar playing is really bad. They are only recommended for loosers. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this album and avoid CD's from the Cars, Nirvana, and AC/DC who suck. Listen to good bands like Foreigner and Dire Straits insted. ps.the cars are for babies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"There are some great songs on this cd. Club Paradiso,&quot;Be Cool,Love Child,I Found Heaven,and the title track are my favs. It's smooth jazz with a tropical twist. Be Cool stars Dave Koz another one of my favorite smooth jazz artists"
2,this is whats wrong with most of the smooth jazz genre.lame mechanical tracks thrown over a bed of programmed drums.Its time to get REAL and play it that way!!!!!
5,"This is one of my most favorite Commissioned albums ever. Reason being is because Fred and Marvin are great singers and this was the last project they had together before their solo careers really took flight. I love this album, ""Dare to Believe"" is a classic. ""I'm Learning"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""Love Is The Way"" and ""Come Home"" are two blazing, bumping tracks that will get you bobbing your head. Then the album goes urban praise and worship on the last few tracks which is uplifting and spiritual. ""Draw Me Nearer"" is, vocally, Commissioned at its best. Another one to add to the collection"
5,"Of all the New Order albums that I own, I would have to say that Republic has been my favorite throughout the years. I enjoy listening to this album the whole way through, and with the order that they used to lay out the songs, you can have it on repeat and want to listen to it again and again.   So you can understand my interpretation of the feel of the album and why I like it, I will tell you that I enjoy this album because of the musical style it has, which in my opinion, has a timeless and smooth quality to it. Each song starts out brilliantly, and although it would go well on a pop radio station, it seems a little more mature and unique than your typical pop tune, using a fine combination of guitars, keyboards, and at times, a choir and a symphony. To describe the feel of each song, as each song progresses, you become more settled as the rythm and the background (almost a classical style-like music) resonates and blends with the guitars and keyboards even more as the song reaches it's climax. Bernard Sumner's vocals seemed to be most at home with this style. With Coldplay, Dido, Sarah McLachlan, Delerium, Balligomingo, and many others in my most frequently listened to category, this one definitely goes well in the mix... the mix for chillin. :"
1,"This is truly one of the worst Goth and related genre compilations I have ever heard.  With the PARTIAL Exception of disk # 2, the songs chosen of even the best bands were among their worst or most mundane songs. It almost seems as if someone was given a list of bands and their songs and said 'pick songs to go on this album' they put up a list of songs up on a board and picked them by randomly throwing darts at it.  Great bands on disk 1, but again they picked some of the more mundane songs overall from Bauhaus, Legendary Pink Dots, Die Form, Christian Death (Disk 4) and some of the more classic favorites. Again- on disk 2 which showed the most promise for other than the utterly mundane they had poor song choices- for example they chose 'Drool' for Switchblade Symphony (which is a band I truly adore otherwise) which is one of their least impressive and mundane songs. Though they made it clear by the intro this was not just 'goth' music, but supposed to encompass Industrial and Darkwave as well, I was stunned at how little Gothic and Darkwave music there really was- and was perplexed as to why they bothered putting metal-related bands on like Two Witches and several others on the compilation. A few good songs scattered on disk 2 and 3, but why pay for 4 disks of music with some to a few good songs on each, when everything worth listening to could have just gone on 1 album? Hours of boredom listening for a few gems.  For a good compilation I would recommend the Goth Box and the Disease of Lady Madeline"
2,"AFI's debut album is a great deal different from their last few CDs.  There is no traces of Goth or pop punk here, just straight up old school punk with some truly hilarious lyrics.  The problem with this album is it's all the same, there's almost no variation, so it's good when you listen to just a few tracks (all of which are good) but put back to back it's impossible to get through the entire CD without a headache.  The two standout tracks for me are ""High School Football Hero"" and the Classic ""I Want a Mohawk but My Mom Won't Let Me Get One"". The music reminds me alot of MxPx's debut CD ""Pokinatcha"", but the lyrics are alot more similar to the Offspring.  Definitely a good CD if you wanna see where the band started and you're already a fan, but if you're new to AFI and want to backtrack from Sing the Sorrow or Decemberunderground I recomend either Black Sails in the Sunset or the All Hallows EP instead"
4,I have now retracted an earlier negative review. I have played it since and enjoyed it. I was overly critical. I do play it and enjoy it.  (ONE AND ONLY LOVE ALBUM) REALLY DOES BLOW THIS ONE AWAY THOUGH AND I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME (100 STARS)
5,"Whenever anyone lists Joe's best albums, this one always appears at the top of any list.  It really is amazing, with some of Joe's signature work, not the least of which is Summer Song, which has sort of become his anthem.  This is a powerful song that rocks nonstop.  The title track gets down in it, and the song Friends carries such an optimistic feel to it.  Joe is the master at delivering a message without saying a single word.  His guitar does the speaking for him, and it speaks beautifully.  War and Motorcycle Driver are another couple of hard rockers.  Cryin' is easy and more contemplative, and Rubina's Blue Sky Happiness sounds like a courtship song, something to be played on a warm spring day with your sweetie.  I'm not sure what the name The Extremist means, but if it involves Joe's mastery of the electric guitar, then the title sure fits him. "
2,"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, ""then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.""  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.           "
5,"The is a wonderful collection of hymns.  Alan should do more acoustic work. Glad his mother was finally able to get him to cut the CD.  Sang most of the songs while growing up in El Paso.  Already liked Alan but this collection of songs shows he is blessed with talent.    Have bought 2 of these to share with family members.  My aunt who just turned 99, thought it was great. "
1,I wish I could have found a snippit of each song when deciding whether or not to purchase this album. Instead I relied upon the other reviews and my memory of 'Take On Me' and 'The Living Daylights' from when I was younger.  I decided to take a chance and purchase this album.  I listened to the album once and have no real desire to hear it again.  The music/lyrics stink (unless the listener considers hearing about broken relationships and lack of commitment to other people and oneself enjoyable).  I would definitely listen to any of Ah-Ha's albums/songs prior to deciding whether or not to purchase them
4,"Mirman's humor is an acquired taste, but once you acquire that taste, you will keep coming back and reveling in its deliciousness over and over again.  The problem with Eugene lies mostly in the fact that you have to appreciate utter absurdity in order to enjoy him.  I can enjoy it and I love the album.  Take a sample, if you like one bit, take the whole thing. Otherwise, wait awhile, Mirman needs time to truly live up to his potential which he gives us a peak at in ""Florida"" and ""Shapes for Sale."" "
1,"Do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably? Well, Eugene Mirman is less entertaining than that guy.  I'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter... that's the most laughter here, and yes, this was recorded live. How the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me. Perhaps it's a tax write-off"
1,"This just furthers my argument even more. Just because an album is more than 10 years old by a ""legendary"" group doesn'tmean that it's good or even a classic. This is classh** at its finest. I actually owned this album at one point when I was young and stupid. But i wasn't that stupid cause I got rid of it quick. You mean to tell me this album is derived from true creativity from ones heart. Lyrics that mean somethin. Thats what hip hop is all about and this is not a hip hop album. There is nothin creative about this album at all. Its a dance album for freaks. Now if you lookin at this from that point of view, then I guess this is a 5 star album. But for someone to call this a hip hop classic you have no idea what a hip hop classic is. You just don't. Damn can the state of hip hop be so f***ed up when anything by 2 LIve Crew can be considered worth owning, let alone being called a classic? If you give this 5 stars,then trash garbage rappers the likes of Chingy, Nelly, Trina, Khia, Camron, DFB, D4L. then your the biggest hypocrite typing reviews on amazon. 2 Live Crew in my opinion, lyrically is in the top 5 of the worst rappers in history. And they are just as one dimensional as your most hated rapper. If you don't believe me just scope out ALL their album covers and song titles. And ask yourself can you really call these bums artist. Seriously I cant get it through my head why somebody over the age of 18 would actually by this s***. I just cant"
1,Maybe it's just me and I'm expecting so much when I spend my money or a little bit of time listenin' to these new n*ggas. But I'm just not feelin' this s*it here. I fell asleep mid way through this album. I just can't seem to understand why these n*ggas is so one dimesional. I cant underdstand why people still supportin' these n*ggas. Not one track was tolerable. If dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s*it away already. Word of advice dont buy this.
2,"I write from the perspective of a life-long fan. This was one of the first modern bands that I loved and I followed their every release from my preteen years onward. They seemed to never miss the mark creatively or sonically, and the increasingly strong imagination and coherence behind each record was only matched by the increasingly complex production. But on this release, they seem to have run out of ideas and melodies and passion. That hurts to say, but it is painfully true. I'll accept this as their auto-pilot record. The reason I give it two stars is because it makes me appreciate Yoshimi, an album I initially viewed as a disappointment in the shadow of the Soft Bulletin, as a proper album (albiet a lateral move)"
1,"I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible. Bad beats, bad rhymes the whole nine yards. It seems like Bone went from Thug to Corny and thats coming from a true Bone fan. A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time."
2,No true CW MCCALL fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper's most seminal work!  Looks like I'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with CW McCall's Greatest hits.  What a disappointment
5,"I believe that this is the best song cycle ever written and remains as one of my favourite Guettel pieces. The songs on this CD are extraordinary, extremely well written and cleverly assembled. I have also bought the sheet music which confirms his musical genius even further and also contains many songs not on the CD such as Prometheus, Jesus the Might Conquerer, Life is But a Dream and Build a Bridge, all of which are fabulous. This is a must for all music lovers! You won't regret it"
1,"i feel like crying right now, literally.   i suppose that i saw this coming, even though i'd give anything to avoid it: the goo goo dolls have straight up sold out, and no other band could dissapoint me more than they could.  the goo goo dolls were the sole band that brought me through my teens, and probably had the single most early influence on my taste in music. no other band had the intensity, musically and emotionally, that these guys captured on their earlier albums (albums like jed, hold me up, superstar carwash, or a boy named goo for all of you who started with dizzy). the complete lack of words to describe the feeling a certain song gives you-- you know what i'm talking about- these guys had it in everything they did. had it, past tense.  their progression that critics tote as ""maturing,"" alas, was the dolls slow descent into what they've become now. we (longtime fans) saw it and silently groaned to ourselves, not able to admit to ourselves that it was happening. it started with dizzy up the girl (with what, for or five singles? get serious). don't get me wrong, i enjoy that album, but only because it still has some of the magic that made the goo goo dolls what they were. the songs still felt real. gutterflower was the real omen; but at least the songs were still somewhat interesting, musically.  and so it comes to this, another great band ruining itself. trust me, i tried desperately to like this cd. desperately. but it doesn't feel real. the lyrics are cheesy. the musicianship is way below par (as compard to their creative ability and talent). the songs are forgetable and all sound the same. the only song i found somewhat enjoyable was ""listen."" (the only taste of real ggd i could find on this cd). (and only two songs with robby on vocals? its a shame. his raspy voice is beautiful.)  its hurts me immensely to say these things about john and robby. they've been my idols for more than half of my life. it feels like a part of me is dead. sounds cheesy, but the ggd have never dissapointed me. time to face up to the facts: they finally have. i guess all good things come to an end.  so if you want to hear some good music, go to the used cd store and pick up superstar carwash, and hear what this really great band used to sound like."
4,What a combination!  Releasing a soundtrack that would pit traditional southern critics of bluegrass against rabid White Stripes fans from Detroit!  I'm sure that Jack White isn't the only performer who is delighted with the controversy this album generated.  Musicians just love the music......it's the critics who need to take a hike.  This is a great album that showcases BOTH great traditional bluegrass AND well known rock musicians displaying a love of the human feeling that is embodied in bluegrass.  So.....quitcherbitchin and enjoy it for what it is.....a nice soundtrack to a movie that showcases bluegrass for a wide popular audience
5,I love the last Five Years so much and so when this came out I got it immeadiately.  The song Over is so great I listened to it Over and Over (no pun intended)  I thnk no one does a ballad like Jason and I highly recommend the whole albu
5,"There is no doubt that I would rate this as one of the best abums of the 80's and Sonic Youth's best abum. However, if you are not a Sonic Youth fan already, I would steer you to their olater albums first. This album is very atmosphereic. It changes moods from mellow and pensive to raging guitar riffs. It has an almost purposeful low-fi sound (think of early albums from Dinosaur Jr. or Guided by Voices). If you are not into experimental, indie rock, go to Sonic Youth's later albums like ""Goo"" or ""Dirty"". They are more accessible. ( I wouldnt say that they compromise integrity though) However, if you are a music explorer; someone who likes bands like radiohead, there is a reason that Sonic Youth are considered the godfathers(with apologies to Kim Gordon, the female bassist) of underground music. I defy you to talk to a person who loves indie rock who does not love this band, and particularly this album."
5,"Stars - Set Yourself on Fire 5 out of 5 Stars  To take a cue from the great single that never was,"" Elevator Love Letter"", from Stars' last under heard/appreciated release, Heart.  I humbly submit my love letter to Stars' latest magnum opus, Set Yourself on Fire:  Dear Set Yourself on Fire,  You've got some nerve, coming into my life under the pretense of eletronica and then making me feel something so strong. You grew on me. The last time I felt this way was when I first fell for The Beautiful South. Your interplay of male/female parts by singers Amy Millan and Torquil Campbell is unparalleled now. From the stunning propulsion on your namesake track through the cinematic sensuality of ""The First Five Times"", I feel you.  I know I've only known you for a few months, but I feel like we've been together much longer. I have a massive crush on you. You're all chill songs, goose bumps and couch dancing fun. You glide into the room with ""Your Ex Lover is Dead, but your hopeful closing refrain (""Calendar Girl"") is ""I'm alive!"" It's sadly beautiful.  You're an album, a collection of songs that come together to form something greater. Taken alone, your songs are great (""Ageless Beauty"" and ""Reunion""), but together they are unstoppable. Our time together is precious, there's no wasting it with any clunkers. You're listenable all the way through, good for driving, headphones, partying and maybe later...making out? It's inspiring, tragic, and heart warming. Your strings and horns are hot and the piano, harmonies and glockenspiel are your prettiest eyes. I'm riding this rollercoaster of mood swings, dancing and tempo shifts. ""I am trying to say what I want to say without having to say..."" Dare I say love, during wartime? It's 2005 and we're alive. You're the reason I listen to and look forward to new music. You're my payoff. What are you doing on Saturday?   --- Jeff Kami"
5,"People, honestly, who cares if Franz Ferdinand is today's best band or if this album is ""funky"" or not. This album is just good ol' fun music that's not at all watered down or lackluster. Just listen to this album and dance to it. Not every critical acclaimed album has to be a masterpiece."
1,"Someone here says ""alot of indie snobs love Deerhoof"". That's correct, and that pretty much speaks volumes. Here's another band with hip vintage equipment, boring song structures, alot of connections, and nothing to say. As if there weren't enough of these bands out there. Absolutely nothing of consequence is going on here: it basically boils down to a phenomenal waste of human and natural resources to make this band's CDs and release them to their 30 or so fans (mostly indie rock CD store clerks). It is also a waste of your time, and mine, giving them another moment of thought.  Extra points docked for the worst band name ever"
2,"As a long time Beach Boys fan who is in his 50's, I was rooting for Brian Wilson to pull this off.  Unfortunately, this is a very mediocre album and in places really grates on me.  My wife made me take it out of the player in the car.  ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes and Villains"" realize the potential of the 60's versions and shine as the albums best cuts.  Most of the rest of the album is unlistenable.  It is Pet Sounds progressing to the next level (not a good thing) and almost sounds like a Pink Floyd ""Dark Side of the Moon"" wanna be, only 35 years too late, and not as listenable"
5,Don't listen to the other reviewers this IS the original soundtrack for the film when Harry Met Sally.  Buy it and enjoy it
5,"Jazz, R&B, Rock, Soul, Funk, and Pop music had all existed before 1982, but when this album came out, it literally combined all the elements and paved the way for what music is today. From recordings to performances to worldwide sales and recognition, Jackson set the standards for it all. Hundreds of years from now, this will still be looked back on as quite possibly one of the finest albums ever recorded.  While Quincy maintained his masterful touch on all the recordings, Jackson lent his to the timeless compositions of ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", ""Beat It"", and ""Billie Jean"", songs that have literally become signature songs of the 1980s, and showed the world just how musical Michael could be. Aside from those recordings, master songwriter Rod Temperton (""Rock with You"", ""Off the Wall"", ""Always and Forever"") and R&B soulman James Ingram contributed their own unique tracks, as well. From ""Thriller"" to ""P.Y.T."", every song here literally changed the course of music as a whole.  While some have maintained that there are far better albums in music history's catalogue, I have yet to come across any with as much quality, energy, diversity, and versatility as this one. A masterpiece"
2,"Most upsetting about PORT OF MIAMI is that being a big fan of the organ-filled ""Hustlin'"", I was hoping that quality-wise the entire album would stand up to that brilliant for single. Unfortunate for the somewhat fortunate debut (#1 on the Billboard 200 with 187,000 copies sold), the album to put it bluntly stinks.  Sure ""Hustlin'"" along with a generic repeat of Young Jeezy's massive ""Soul Survivor"" hit (""Cross The Line"" which features nobody else by Konvikt Akon), are fine, but otherwise, Ross has more inhabitions than attributes.  While idealy Ross should compete with new standouts such as Southern rapper Young Jeezy or T.I., or even more less known names such as Slim Thug or Bun B, he doesn't make the cut against any of those artist. In fact, Ross's gravely vocals tend to grate rather than inspire, all except on the opening tracks such as the above par ""Push It"", ""Hustlin'"", ""Cross The Line"", or ""I'm Bad"".  Otherwise, Ross unfortunately falls on death ears.  It makes you wonder that if Ross were to ever release a sophomore album, would it be successful?  With such boasts made of him by Diddy and Jay-Z, mega hip-hop stars and talent-searchers, you wonder who dropped the ball with the excution of this star's album, which is terrible to say about any new artist.  And without a true single tall enough to stand against the incredible but minor radio cut (it never did really well despite fan support) ""Hustlin'"", you wonder if after an impressive debut and support if the only way for Ross is down instead of up?    No, I'm not putting Ross down, but I can't help but to say that I was expecting a meatier, Grammy worthy debut from Ross instead of the rather hit-absent PORT OF MIAMI.  Does he rep good for Miami? Sure, but hopefully a second round will make Ross more mature and more likeable than a rather bland debut.  2 stars for the album, 4.5 for killer single ""Hustlin'"", a sure to be rap classic"
5,"OMG When I heard he was comin got with an album after the whole B2K break-up, I was surprised as hell!. I brought it and love every single song except for ""Never Gonna Let You Go"" I dont like that song really. I love the album coming from a true B2K fan i thought it was gonna be like the same ol' B2K stuff but with 1 person but I was really surprised. He really matured on this album and I love it. Love You O   "
1,"I never got through listening to this whole album... I bought it because I was a fan of Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini - but just hearing the first few minutes of Kelly's version of Respect, I lost interest.  I don't recall ever putting the cd in the cd player after that time. So if you like Kelly and Justin, buy their albums instead"
2,"Is it just me, or do all Sting's new songs these days sound basically the same?  I've loved Sting's quirky, compelling - and not infrequently erudite - songwriting and music-making as far back as I can remember, from early Police through to 'Ten Summoner's Tales' - but every time I listen to one of the newer albums, I just get a feeling of wading through formless aural goo that refuses to coalesce into anything resembling a distinctive voice or vision.  I don't WANT Sting to make Part 2 of 'Turtles' or 'Summoner' (artists have to evolve and explore to be worth listening to) but I miss the clever playfulness of 'Englishman' or 'Heavy Cloud', the sombre poetry and sweeping thematic unity of the whole 'Soul Cages' album and the heartbreaking simplicity of 'Fragile' or 'Fields of Gold' - I miss the way the music and words *worked* together, and the way there was always one more thing lurking below the surface if you listened carefully enough, or a cleverer musical joke than you'd initially caught.    The point is, 'Sacred Love', 'Brand New Day' - and even 'Mercury Falling' - could have been made by ANYONE - there just isn't anything that separates these songs (okay, except maybe 'Desert Rose' and 'Thousand Years') from easy listening elevator music, nothing that makes them Sting's and not just another faceless product that exists mainly as background to a slickly edited music video.  Even the outrage seems carefully calibrated -'This War' is certainly no 'Russians' (even discounting the brilliantly quoted Prokofiev theme), and the extra verbiage is neither forceful nor intelligent enough to induce me to actually listen, as opposed to letting it play in the background.    On the plus side, I am looking forward to getting hold of the new album of Elizabethan songs - Sting certainly has the musical smarts to take on such a challenge, and I'm keen to see how he handles the delivery of the music.  But I'll still miss the old Sting - the one who could make me dive into a book to check a reference while simultaneously making music that always had something new to offer - and I'll continue to live in hope"
1,"I don't listen to the radio much. In fact, it would be closer to the truth to say that I actively AVOID listening to the radio, whenever possible. But it seems that no matter where I go, I can't escape the constant airplay of Green Day's megahit ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams.""  I don't hate this song because it has a bland, repetitive structure, or because of the band's lackluster musical talents, or Billie Joe's grating vocals. Those are all valid reasons to hate ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" but my reason is my own: The lyrical content. Let's take a look, shall we?  ""I walk a lonely road The only one that I have ever known""  Yeah, sure, whatever you say. Not only does Billie Joe have a wife of nearly twelve years, he also has numerous friends and MILLIONS of adoring fans throughout the world and was voted ""Sexiest Rock Star"" by Kerrang!, and suddenly he's telling me how lonely he is? He's probably never experienced one moment of true loneliness in his whole life! What kind of hypocrisy is this? The whole song is nothing but Billie Joe whining about how he walks alone and how he wishes ""someone out there will find me"" which comes out painfully contrived and insincere.  ""Oh, you're overreacting,"" you say. Well, maybe I am. But the truth is, I am violently sick of bands churning out shallow, meaningless drivel with some mopey lyrics to try to make money off of people's misery; and it's not just Green Day, either. Bands like Linkin Park, Evanescence, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, and many others all seem to be hooked on trying to parlay their so-called ""loneliness"" into their albums not because they really feel such emotions and wish to honestly express them, but because it sells albums.  Misery isn't trendy. Songs like this and countless others aim for your pocketbook by pretending to ""feel your pain."" These hacks aren't worth a dime"
1,I would like to know what type of people are writing these reviews and what state of musical knowledge they have i've never written a review but after reading what these plutocrates have wrote i have to respond this cd is on par with Ant and Dec its terrible she waffles on with an annoying high piched voice about english mcs sounding american then she tries to sound like a cracked out missy elliot who also is terrible she has absolutely zero talent and im amazed she has a record deal its borders on treason that shes allowed to hold a mi
1,cocorosie sucks.  They can't sing.  And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song. 
2,"BeBe and CeCe demonstrate great comprimise in this sad collection of &quot;gospel&quot; songs because almost every cut can also be interpreted as a secular love song.  Unlike a true gospel artist like Vickie Winans,  who has the ability to evangalize through her music, these performers seem  to be embarrassed about being inspirational.  This disc is for the bubble  gum Christian, not for the listener who takes his or her faith seriously"
5,"Lila Downs is by far the most amazing vocalist of our time. I have all her CD's and can't wait until the next.  Her music and live shows are inspiring and moving.  She's a Latina who keeps it real and is proud of who she is, where she comes from and where she's been. I had the honor of meeting her and her inner beauty surely compliments her outer beauty.  Her talent is moving, and her humility inspiring.  I recommend this CD 100% as well as all her others.  Hear it for yourself... and catch her live performances when she's in your town"
1,"Let's get one thing strait: I am deffidently not a punk hater, and DEFFIDENTLY not an mtv loser fan. In fact, punk rock is my favorite type of music. But I did not like punk o rama volume 5. I just did not find it cool, catchy, or even ok. It sucked. The only songs I really liked were the Pennywise song and the Vision song(which is about being close minded, and I don't like people who are close minded), and the Pulley song was okay, though the singer's voice annoys the heck outta me. The rest is bland, unoriginal, and annoying. Even the Rancid song was annoing. Yes, you heard me right. Everyone's so-called favorite punk band's song was annoying. At Borders, I had the choice between this and AFI's All Hollows E.P. I now know better than that. If you liked this CD, fine. Just remember to buy good punk CDs from bands like The Distillers, Misfits, The Ramones, Offspring, Rise Against, and early AFI, out of respect for good punk"
4,This is the Santana &quot;best of&quot; for people who don't need a collection of songs that can be heard on any classic rock station within minutes of tuning in. The deeper tracks from Abraxus included here are more than worth while
1,"Five stars for the music but reduced to one star for content and value.    Value???  At around $135 this box set to mark Tony Bennett's 80th birthday year is obviously aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan / collector, rather than at the casual buyer.  With that in mind one is left wondering what exactly it was that Sony/Columbia thought they were giving to us that was so special?  What we have ended up with is a frustratingly mixed bag.  Firstly, the packaging.    The picture on Amazon seems to be an early mock up of the set, as the finished product is more elaborate.  The box is a cube covered in black velour with Bennett's signature embossed into the top.  The front of the box has a perspex panel with a pencil portrait of the singer.  Behind this is a montage of miniature album covers and photos, set slightly back from the panel to give a 3D effect.  Above this on the top front surface of the box is a small silver metallic plate with Bennett's signature.    In the base of the box is a ribbon tag which when pulled reveals a small, hard backed book of approximately 60 pages, again covered in black velour with another small silver metallic plate featuring the singer's signature.  Contents of the book are a collection of charcoal and pencil sketches by the singer and a collection of brief (and I do mean brief) hand-written personal comments on the albums included in the set.  All very nice, but as a fan of the music I would have prefered recording information, anectdotes about the original album releases, session details, etc.      At approximately 7.5"" x 7.5"" x 7.5"", the box will be an awkward if not impossible fit on the shelf beside the rest of your CDs.  OK - so what about what we really came here for, namely, the music?  This is where the above mentioned frustration comes in.  Let's take it album by album.  First of all there are several already available CDs, but in digitally remastered form, some with and some without bonus tracks.  These are:  I Left My Heart In San Francisco - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   The Art of Excellence - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   Perfectly Frank - No bonus cuts but significantly improved sound quality over the previous release.   MTV Unplugged - Two bonus cuts (""Just a Little Street Where Old Friends Meet"" / ""When Will the Bells Ring for Me?"") and  slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  The Movie Songs - Two bonus cuts (""A Time for Love"" / ""The Shining Sea"") and slightly improved sound quality over the previous release.  Then we have a selection of albums that come under the banner of ""pointless"" as they have already been available for some time, already previously remastered:  Cloud Seven - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Beat of My Heart - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  If I Ruled the World: Songs for the Jet Set - Same as the previous release with no noticeable difference in sound quality.  The Tony Bennett / Bill Evans Album - An even more puzzling inclusion.  Not a Columbia release, but recorded for the Fantasy label in the '70s.  This is the original Fantasy CD release, not even repackaged for the box set by Columbia.  It's just as if they bought a bunch of these from Fantasy and popped them into this collection.  However, and again frustratingly, this is NOT the 20 Bit remastered edition of this CD that has been available for several years but the non-remastered, sonically inferior release from the late '90s.  Perhaps Fantasy had a few thousand of these that they couldn't get rid of because they had been superseded by the remastered edition and unloaded them on Sony/Columbia?  Whatever the reason this is a slipshod inclusion in the set, to say the least.  Next is one album already previously released and remastered, but here in a slightly amended form.  I Wanna Be Around - No noticeable difference in sound quality, but with different bonus cuts from the previous release.  The previous CD release of this album included as a bonus, seven tracks from the ""This Is All I Ask"" album, a somewhat bizzarre and half-baked addition, as all of the  tracks from ""This Is All I Ask"" would have fitted on to the disc making a two-on-one release.  For the box set release we have three different bonus tracks ""If I Love Again"" (alternate take) / ""Someone To Love"" (alternate take) / ""Indian Summer"".  So - if you want all of the bonus material you have to hold on to your (now deleted) previous CD release of this album.  The next album again comes under the heading of totally pointless:  The Singles Collection - considering this box set is aimed at the hardcore Bennett fan and not the casual buyer (casual buyers don't drop $135 on a whim), another ""Greatest Hits"" variant is completely pointless.  Something tells me that the people likely to be forking over their hard-earned moolah for this box will already have everything on this disc, probably several times over.  Heaven forbid Sony/Columbia should have given the fans something so outrageous as a disc of rare and unreleased tracks instead of this, their umpteenth hits compilation.   Finally, two albums that finally deliver the goods for the fans.  Tony Bennett Sings for Two - Briefly available on CD many years ago but rapidly withdrawn for some reason.  This remastered version offers significant improvement in sound quality over the previous release.  When Lights are Low - first time ever relese anywhere in the world on CD (so far as I can ascertain).  An absolute gem.  More of this type of album -i.e. never before available on CD- is what this collection needed.  So - what do we have at the end of the day for the Bennett faithful?  One previously unavaiable on CD release and one long unavailable on CD album,  three albums in exactly the same form they are already avaiable in,  one album in an inferior version to what is already available, one album with different bonus cuts to its previous release, five albums with remastered sound (two with bonus cuts) and, finally, one totally pointless ""hits"" collection.    Considering that approximately thirty Tony Bennett albums have never had a CD release, many more are long deleted on the format and bearing in mind the considerable amount of unreleased material in the vaults, this collection is a completely botched undertaking, a missed opportunity and a pretty shoddy commemoration of the man's 80th birthday.  Just exactly who executive producer Danny Bennett and Sony/Columbia are aiming this box set at is a bit of a mystery.  If it is the dedicated fan, then I have to tell all parties involved in this release that we expect a lot more than two unavailable albums, a collection of already avaialble cleaned up recordings and seven -count'em folks- previously unavailable tracks for our $135.  Just what are the chances, I wonder, of Tony Bennett's back catalogue making it to CD before his original fanbase -or for that matter his newer devotees- are all in their graves?   This is a sorry monument to a great artist's 80th year.  (AFTERTHOUGHT: I'm still puzzled over the unusual number of discs in the set, namely, thirteen.  Not a dozen, not twenty. but thirteen.  Go figure.  You know what they say about the number 13 - ""...unlucky for some..."".  In this case the unlucky ones are Mr Bennett's fans.)                 "
2,"Although Petra has a sweet voice, I felt her songs sounded juvenile and scattered."
2,I never really noticed the soundtrack when watching this show on television but I love the show so was a little surprised when purchasing the album that all the non sound bite tracks are American country music songs. Can't say I'm much of a fan of American country music so was just a bit disappointed. I think a great inclusion on this album though is the sound bites from all the leading housewife characters on this show and this alone is worth the price of the CD.   Was also disappointed that Danny Elfman's Desperate Housewives Theme is not a separate track and ridiculously has some hidden track attached to it. The Desperate Housewives Theme goes for 0:44 seconds then you have a break of silence for a while but still on the same track before at 1:01 a terribly sung summary of the TV show mentioning Wisteria Lane over and over again follows for a minute and twenty seconds. What ligic was there in not making this a separate track? You would then be able to memory it out on your stereo. I like listening to TV themes and I find this just ruins that track because you need to be near your stereo to press skip after 0:44 seconds. This CD is worth purchasing for the sound bites alone but I guess if you're just buying it for the theme song you'll have to wait for some other new TV theme compilation album to get the theme song on its own.   This album also comes with an excellent cover insert booklet with lots of great pictures of characters and scenes from the show.
5,"I am one of the people who got the album when it originally came out.  I had it memorized.  When it first came out on CD, I was disapoointed.  I had noticed that quite a bit of it was cut, especially the bit he talks about before the VSM.   However, when I found that the Legacy CD came out.  I had to buy it.  Boy, I have not been disappointed.  It is great.  It is even better because they have added some songs that were not even on the original CD. "
5,"This is the kind of CD that you don't skip over any tracks on. You can't help but to knod your head and tap your fingers to each beat and imagine being in a small intimate venue hearing the songs being played live.  Most of the songs are kind of fast. Great driving CD.  Favorite Tracks: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11 and you gotta love track 13 (also on his previous CD). "
1,"I bought this album because I am so into Sigur Ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews I read say that ""...if you like Sigur Ros you will like MBV.."" Let me say this album is no where near a Sigur Ros experience. If  I could compare them to anyone it would be very early Cocteau Twins , though I must be clear I don't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of Elizabeth Fraser. It would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible. The sound quality is comparable to some old VHS tapes I have from the mid 80's that I recorded off the TV ( Then soaked in water for a few days!) ."
1,"WOW. 12 dollars for this CD. I must have seen this album in every stores 1 dollar bargain bin, and their wasn't one CD their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier"
2,"ok, I bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs ""Believe"" and ""I'm Building Bridges"". The other songs are horrible. Ronnie is the lead vocalist for a VERY good reason! They were very smart to get Vince Gill(the best!)to do background vocals on Bridge's. Save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale!"
5,"This and Dark Side of the Moon are the most balanced records Pink Floyd has ever produced.  Just the right amount of sax, synth, drums, guitar, and vocals.  The album is a little different than their ealier stuff as it has mostly a possitive sound to it, in other words don't come from the Wall listening to this without giving it some time.  The only thing in question really are the ""A New Machine"" tracks, which are certainly different, not something you would just jump into. Will you ever like them if you don't like them inittially?  Probably not.  But other than that, everything else is utter perfection for the style of music they represent.  Listen to this album a few times and trust me, you'll love it"
2,"Note to soundtrack producers: When we buy a soundtrack with a bunch of good songs, we want to hear the songs. Sure, a bunch of dialog scattered throughout is fine and fun, but not when it's cut into the music! (See the soundtrack to ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"" for how to do it right.)  Basically, what they've done here, is try to create some new experience that isn't quite the movie and isn't quite the soundtrack. You don't get to hear the full versions of the songs as the artists recorded them. The beginnings and the ends are crossfaded together with snippets of dialog. It's like a soundtrack/radio drama hybrid with no plot. The dialog runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, which runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, etc., throughout the entire CD. On the first listen, you think, ""Oh, yeah, Ed complaining that the zombie blew the call-and-response in 'White Lines.' That was funny...,"" but then you're kind of screwed for the rest of your life because the editors have mixed in the boys doing their, ""...diggeda, diggeda, diggeda..."" bit right into the middle of the song. If you truly want to hear 'White Lines' or any of the other tunes, you'll have to get them elsewhere. Sorry.   I'm not sure what the objective was with this disc, but if I wanted to relive the movie, I'd pop in the DVD. If I wanted to hear the songs, I would have liked to have played the CD, but that won't work here. The songs and the movie dialog on this CD are like Siamese twins sharing a single stomach. You get one, you get the other and there's no separating them. This is a bummer since they're good songs.   What I've got now is a CD novelty that I really can't use. I may trot it out once a year, but I'll be disappointed every time. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay.."
4,"It is difficult to rate and review 'Time Out of Mind,' Bob Dylan's start to a string of late Renaissance achievements.  The album, which is named after Mercutio's line before Romeo crashes the Capulets' masquerade ball in 'Romeo and Juliet, 'finds Dylan ""Love Sick"" with a world that has gone wrong and left him bewildered.  These subject matters are deftly taken up with the blues with his excellent new band and Daniel Lanois at the producer helm and Jack Frost just in the wings.  The highlights are hallmark.  Even though his voice has aged and is more gravelly, it does appropriately remind one of Leon Redbone, which suits his new endeavors well.  ""Love Sick"" is thick and bottom-line.  With some hefty guitar chords he sings his heart out.  Then, he comes up with ""Dirt Road Blues,"" arguably the C.D.'s best song.  With what can be described as rockabilly blues, he and his band transport us to the Texas border for some hot chili.  ""Starting in the Doorway"" reminds us of his vintage work.  Sometimes this number gets as langorous, however, like the ""...summer night..."" he walks through.  Similarly, ""Million Miles"" is good blues, even if the title tells us much about the length of the destination.  ""Trying to Get to Heaven"" and the beautifully shimmering ""Not Dark Yet,"" really hit the spot with two of his top songs here.  Also worthy of his latter legacy is the celebrated ballad, ""Make You Feel My Love,"" which is as eloquent and substantial as his best love songs.  Also good quality can be found with the heavy ""Cold Irons Bound"".  This song lingers a bit too long, but especially the closer, ""Highlands,"" doesn't come close to reaching the destination and isn't close to climbing to the heights of a classic like ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"".    'Time Out of Mind' was able to capture enough attention by landing Dylan on the cover of 'Newsweek' magazine.  He deserved it anyway, but this album is a mixed comeback, providing some disapointment despite the hype.  In spots he delivers his old genius in a different venue, but 'Oh, Mercy,' before it, and 'Modern Times,' after it demonstrate that there are a lot of Dylan classics to be found more worthy than 'Time Out of Mind'"
4,This is his weakest attempt but it is still very good and consistent throughout the album. Now why is it his worst because it sounds too commercial for me and that is my opinion and other people will say otherwise. I like almost every song here but I skip about 4 of them and the rest I can listen to all the way through. I recommend this album to fans of down south music and maybe rap fans in general but most rap fans probably never heard of him and most are skeptic but I recommend it
1,"It's tough not to surpass judgment on the ruinous film when attempting to evaluate the soundtrack of `Rent' because the big screen adaptation was as intolerable as countless nonsensical movie tie-ins that MTV used to excel at force-feeding down our throats.  But what exactly is missing from this recording?  Well, while it's hard to pinpoint, it is so easy to comprehend.  There is no joy - no hope - no struggle in the mechanized performances.  We don't experience the lyrics, we remain unmoved by the static orchestration - each musical number is executed as stoically as a soundtrack should not be presented - on stage, such enunciation and bombast is called for; in a film there is room for embellishment - and restraint.  Here, there is none - only aging players, too old for their roles, caterwauling mind-numbing denunciations and explorations.  What `Rent' lacks is a timeless score, despite its cult status.  While some tracks retain their original prettiness, more often than not we are assaulted with Jim Steinman-like pomposity from a cast that can't seem to project over the deafening drum machine.  If you must revel in `Rent', dole out the cash for the original cast recording.  At least there's Daphne Rubin-Vega.  My grade:  C-"
2,"Yeah i read the reviews on how great this album is. Dont get me wrong its unique but that doesnt mean im gonna feel it. Im sure some underground head is gonna read this and trip and write a review dissin me. So let me tell you there is just as much fake ass artists in the underground as mainstream. So dont discriminate mainstream and underground. Give mainstream a chance. You might like it. I dont even talk about whats what anymore. I like Outkast, The Game, and some G Unit that doesnt make me a ""a non true hip hop head"". Oh yeah back to the album. I really didnt like it cuz it was borin and left me thinking about other things. Im mad that i bought this cd. I will give him a 2 star for effort though. Heed my words majority kids"
1,"Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams"
2,"This sounds a lot like 'Out of time', but not quite as good in some  respects. 'Pop song 89' is a perfect opening to the album, it moves along nicely and is pretty catchy. Other highlights include 'World Leader Pretend', with nice percussion and steel guitars.  There are three acoustic songs which began kind of a theme on the next couple of albums. 'You are the everything' to me has absolutely no melody and moves along rather boringly. 'The wrong child' attempts to utilise harmony vocals. They are completely out of key with each other. Another poor effort. The high 'OKAYYYY' parts are unbelievably out of tune. 'Hairshirt' is third cut in the same vein as the previous two. Same chordal structure without much melody going on anywhere. Clearly, the ballads needed to be perfected. 'Orange Crush' is a more catchy tune. Mike Mills can also be heard in the chorus and, at the risk of sounding controversial, he actually has a better voice. Much purer. Why he did not sing any lead until the next album, is just unbelievable. Probably the strongest track. The best way of summing up this album is that it consists of three types of songs... 1) The Pop songs - Pop song 89 (good), Get up (ok), Stand (rubbish), The bonus cut (ok and catchy) 2) The ballads - Mentioned above, all rubbish. 3) The rock songs - World leader Pretend (good - toes line of being a ballad also), I remember California (grundgy, not too bad), Orange Crush (very good), Turn you inside out (rubbish"
2,"Why? ...Words, Lover's Prayer, To Love Somebody...why? I was pleased to hear Juliet again but resinging Barry's leads is a mistake. Would have loved to hear the brothers together doing a tribute album to Mo instead. When I look at this album, all I can say is ""Why?"
1,"Biggie put her on the map. Why, i'll never know. So she sucked off the fame he gave her (not the only thing she's been sucking) Also, being a Biggie fan, the name of this cd (proving my point about Biggie) was offensive and disrespectful. This is not rap, this is pop. If you think this is rap, you need to get smacked with a ""The Lost Children of babylon"" album and learn real rap. Nothing but two dollar trash by a two dollar wh*re"
5,"Jesus &amp; Mary Chain have 2 sets of fans, those who like the feedback drenched &quot;Psychocandy&quot;. And the rest of us, who like everything after. &quot;Automatic&quot; is full of 50's - 60's guitar style rockers played in the JMC way. Perhaps, one little flaw is the drum machine. But you can't deny the sheer power of &quot;Her way of praying&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Blues from a gun&quot; and the classic &quot;Head on&quot;. Without all the feedback, the songs really come out! They made it a point to stray away from &quot;Psychocandy&quot;'s sound alltogether and sort of reinvented themselves, pissing off their early fans. (Like the reviewer before me). The band made that very clear with the title of their next great album &quot;Honey's dead&quot; in 1992. Get it"
4,"Excellent album, great songs, beautiful bluegrass voice and some really fine backing muscicians, so why am I left unsatisfied? The total total track length is only 34 minutes! Thats not good value for my purchase, most albums run for 40-50 minutes. Nice album - shame about the length"
1,"Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it"
1,"I am very  dissapointed with this album, it has not the mistyc of VNV.  I suppose that this was only a mistake of these musician stars. I will wait the next release. "
1,"First things first: this compilation shouldn't even be called Jermaine Dupri Presents... because JD is only involved with two songs on here (he stars in ""Gotta Getcha"", and he produces one other song). Anyway, I'm not exactly sure what possessed him to put together Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1; whether he was just thinking about ""the way we were"", or if he just wanted to showcase some new young talent. Actually, maybe I shouldn't have said the latter, because it looks like JD dug up some of the most UNtalented people ever.  But things aren't very inspiring with the known artists, like when J-Kwon and Daz try to save ""10 Toes"". And I wonder how long ago that song was made because in it, J-Kwon says he's 17, but that's how old he was when ""Tipsy"" came out. I don't know WHY JD decided to dig up has-beens KP & Envyi for the dismal ""Put Cha Hands Up"" (that title even sounds like it came from 1997), and as for ""I Think They Like Me"", if it's really Dem Franchize Boyz' song, how come they're the only ones in there that can't rap?  Most of the rappers on here are unknowns, but in the end they really aren't WORTH knowing because even JD is a better rapper than they are. Miss B's ""Grown Man"" suffers from a corny chorus, and T. Waters' ""Throw'd Off"" is just plain wack. And Cato's lazy ""So What"" made me say just that. But the album's nadir is the title track, performed by Young Capone, Midnight, Champagne Shawty and C-Dirt. Not only is there lackluster production, but the guys' rapping is so bad that they make Chingy look like Rakim.  The only saving grace to this whole compilation is Bun-B's verse on the otherwise terrible ""Kodak Moment"". Unlike that title, though, this album isn't anything to remember. If Jermaine ever makes a Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 2, I'll be the first person not to get it.  Anthony Ruper"
5,"This cd is full of emotion, and a lot of fun!   It's like a great story in 10 awesome songs!  1. ""Get Stoned"" takes you back to (or reminds you of) your teenage years of love.  2. ""How Long"" shows the ache of a break up, and how much it hurts to have someone else with the person you love.  3. ""By the Way"" takes you to a place where everyone has/will be one day, wanting everything to be your way, and perfect.   4. ""Nothin' Good About Goodbye"" relates how hard it is to finally cut your love off, and how every time you try to end it, they just keep coming back.   5. ""Bliss (I Don't Wanna Know)"" about the way you try and try to make everything work out and how you really don't want to know it's the end.  6. ""Better Than Me"" is about the realization that you really miss someone but that they deserve much more than what you have to give.  7. ""Room 21"" a great song about a day at a bar that leads to a great night!! 8. ""Lips Of An Angle"" a very emotional song about two people that were in a relationship and are still there for each other. they still wish they were together. 9. ""Homecoming Queen"" a song about a girl that is missing, someone that everyone took for granted!  10. ""Shoulda"" very great song to end the cd with! it is about not saying those 3 little words and wanting to change it!!   This cd is a must buy!!! no matter what kind of music your into.. it is an awesome cd that relates to everyday happenings... it is the best that rock has to offer!!! "
5,Up till now my favorite Chris Whitley album was Dirt Floor. There's another favorite now; this latest album by the late great floor-stomping singer is raw and rocking with a twist. The hard drive works to perfection in combination with a souring violin. Buy this CD and if you do not own a copy of Dirt Floor buy that one tw
5,"""Looking Up"" is absoulutley wonderful! Every single song is great. Gregg Karukas is simply smooth jazz finest musician. This CD is extremley enjoyable and creative"
4,"Hellogoodbye has recently become one of my favorite new bands. They have a unique emo sound , with a touch of techno . The best tracks on their Debut "" Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs!"", in my opinion are their first single "" Here (in your arms)"", "" Baby , It's Fact"" , "" Touchdown Turnaround (don't give up on me) "" , and "" All of your love"" . Their lyrics are just plain catchy , and their songs vary throughout the album . Some are loud , and some are soft love songs . Out of all the songs on the album , I can totally see Touchdown Turnaround as their next single . It's a great song , with really fun lyrics . If your a fan of Bright Eyes , you'll like this band . For some reason , they remind me of them in some songs . It's a fun CD that can be played over and over again."
2,"I cant say i especially like any of the songs on this album. All of them are incredibly repetitive.   If you like aphex's repetitive stuff, buy it, otherwise buy one of his better albums, like Richard D. James or Drukq"
2,I AM DISAPPOINTED OF THIS CD BECAUSE FRED HAMMOND AND RFC IS OFF THE CHAIN BUT THIS CD IS NOT. I REALLY WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT BECUASE THEY HAVE DONE BETTER AND THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU STILL WANT TO BUY IT THEN YOU CAN BUT I REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT. THERE WERE SOME SONGS THAT ARE GOOD BUT THE REST ARE WEA
5,"Commissioned. One of the greatest groups of all time. Really gives it to you with this album. With lush flowing ballads such as,&quot;Do You Still Love Me&quot; and,&quot;Crucified With Christ.&quot; This album also gives you bangin' joints such as,&quot;Irreplaceable Love&quot; and, &quot;I Can Love Agin.&quot; This CD gives you all that you need, and will really help you with your walk with Christ. This is the year 2001, and I still rate this album(done in 1996)number one out of all my music I have at home. In church or out of church, I encurage you to buy this album. You wont be disapointed"
5,"When the Corrs deliver it 'live', they deliver it real good. Whether it is 'covers' or 'originals', it is as good a live album as I have heard. The intimacy with the audience is evident and all the songs stand-up well 'live'. In my view, this is the best 'Corrs' album out there. Bono pops up on two tracks as an added bonus"
5,"By far, this is AFI's greatest release, period, if you don't like it, go kiss Raf. ""No Dave Party"" is an effing great instrumental track, if ya don't know where it is, ya better start looking for it. Every single song on this album is perfect, this is my favorite album of all time. This is the last album with the classic line-up and how fitting that it's their best, no? Geoff went on to play in Tiger Army, he left them and is now in HorrorPops. Geoff's bass playing is superb on this, the Good Stuff to say the least. Mark's guitar playing is pretty good, and Adam's drumming is the fast stuff. Now, good old Davey, the DXH. People will complain and say ""He sounds like he's on elium"" and that ""His voice is too high"". Well, the man was 20 when he recorded this, what d'ya expect? The lyrics are really good too, if you look closely, it's got some pretty good straight edge stuff on it. Then it's got the typical outcast, teen fury stuff. If you're a pissed off teenager and dig the real hardcore stuff-7 Seconds, Minor Threat, Black Flag, etc.-not that fraudcore Atreyu, From First To Last crap you should get this. So yeah, best album ever, buy it.   JX"
2,"Every singer has his song, on this album Robbie nails Beyond The Sea and the rest of the songs suck.  Louis Armstrong nailed Mack the Knife and Frank Sinatra nailed It Was A Very Good Year.  Robbie William does not have the depth these singers have to pull off these songs.  Sorry.  Hope you did not purchase this album.  You can get the Finding Nemo soundtrack for half the price and it has Beyond the Sea on it"
1,"Yeah, this is metal madness!!  Scooter delivers such gruesome lyrics and vocals, the two guitarists do psychotic shredding riffs and blazing solos, the drummer does machine gun double bass at 400 miles per second!!  Metal is revived!!  As you can see, I'm joking.  Scooter has little baby squirel nuts, hence his super weak and annoying voice.  His lyrics about ""I hate my parents, my daddy touched my privates"" tripe is nothing new, and nothing pleasing to the ears.  The guitarists are very bad, they're downtuned and they only do powerchords and don't solo (because they can't).  The drummer is very basic, nothing special.  Bass?  Can't hear it.  Want the best album of 2005?  Go for ""Ghost Reveries"" by Opeth.  Opeth cares about music, Cold only cares about fame and money."
1,"Oo God, one more time!  This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead."
2,"When I saw the Futureheads at Chicago's Empty Bottle in 2004, it was a revelation of jumproping vocal harmonies, savage guitar abuse and anthemic absurdity. The band's self-titled debut album was just as exciting. The Futureheads have barely stopped touring since, and it shows. All of their technical craft remains evident on News & Tributes, but there are few if any memorable moments. The songwriting just isn't there. And believe me: the band knows it. At this year's Pitchfork festival, they played perhaps three songs from N&T, choosing to lean on the older, tighter, hookier material. Want a great new rock album? Go Buy the Tokyo Police Club EP. "
5,"I was curious to listen to David Zinman and the Zurich Orchestra after all I had read in  the CD guide books and magazines. This is my sixth full cycle (Karajan 1963 and 1977, Klemperer,Bernstein/VPO and Toscanini) and these days is definetely my favourite. Zinman brings new life to the symphonies- period. The Barenreiter edition may play a role in the freshness of the music but the passion of maestro and orchestra makes you feel as if you are present in the music hall, being a spectator of a live performance.  The first symphonies were the greatest surprise for me, and I can now see the maturation of Beethoven, where as the older approaches interepreted these pieces as small ""Eroicas"". There is no doubt there are better interepretations of individual symphonies out there - ex. Carlos Kleiber on the 5th, Klemperer on the ""Eroica""-old style or Furtwangler on the 1952 recording of the ""Choral"" - but this fact can not overshadow what I find as an excellent set at a great price"
5,"Ineffably singular.  You think you've heard these symphonies before, but the combination of a smaller orchestra and period instrumentation with ur-text orchestrations makes these recordings a revelation.  Not the least of the set's pleasures is Zinman's respecting of the real tempi called for in the scores - at times a tad faster than they're usually played - which strips the music of the ponderous heaviness that too often creeps in.  One reviewer loved the whole set except for the Fifth, and I can understand why - the Fifth here sounds unlike you've ever heard it before.  I'd say, having listened, that's a good thing.  The best bargain in classical recordings this year"
1,"This is a good example of rap today.  You don't need to be a MC to land a deal, or even know how to rhyme.  All you need to do is come up with a dance move, make songs about your damn clothes and how you party all the time and your on.  This ain't right man... it just ain't right !!"
2,"I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put ""Low Rider"" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that"
4,"1977's ""Enigmatic Ocean"" was indeed a tough act to follow, given the improvisational and sonic brilliance of one Allan Holdsworth on guitar. So, instead of trying to replicate that disc, Ponty wisely leaned more in a rockier/funky direction for ""Cosmic Messenger"", knowing that NOBODY could match Holdsworth's unique contributions or even get close.   What results is a collection of songs that retain a lot of the characteristics of Ponty's earlier efforts but a bit leaner and meaner sounding. Of the 2 guitarists, Peter Maunu definitely comes up the most distinct sounding with his soaring melodic bluesy rock sound. What I really enjoyed though was the huge punchy sounding rhythm section of drummer Casey Schurrel and bassist Ralphe Armstrong (I especially loved Ralphe's huge thick growling fretless tone here, deeeeeelicious!). Allan Zavod provides all the appropriately spacey textures with a bank of synths. Have to admit though I would've loved to hear more acoustic instruments as well to balance it out, as it was a bit synth/electronics heavy.  As for the highlights, ""Ethereal Mood"" is beautifully hypnotic with not much more than acoustic violin, chiming acoustic guitars, fretless bass and tablas, very beautiful haunting melody. On the funkier/rocky side, ""Art of Happiness"", ""Don't Let The World Pass You By"" and ""Fake Paradise"" come out swinging.   The one low point for me is the ending tune ""Egocentric Molecules"" (corny title BTW!), which sounds more like a mathematical exercise more than it does music. Not one of Ponty's better compositional moments in this Owl's opinion.  Overall, a solid album worth having, but not groundbreaking by any stretch. After this, JLP would seem to just keep making the same record over and over again"
2,"While not quite as bad as some of the stinkers which were to follow, this is another terrible effort by the so-called fab four. Yesterday is instantly forgettable, Dizzy Miss Lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50's and Ticket to Ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly. As usual, I did enjoy Ringo's excellent drumming and I liked the song Act Naturally. For shame! "
1,"Imagine no possessions?  Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces.  Imagine no religion?  Fine, if religion's such a ""crutch"", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit.  Imagine no countries?  Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador.  The world will be as one?  Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most.  John Lennon was a text book phony.  He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't.  Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now.  The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation.  His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn.  Thank you very much.  -DW. "
4,"I write this review of ""The Documentary"" as The Game's sophomore release ""Doctor's Advocate"" prepares to be let loose on the populous. In January of 2005 The Game was let loose for the first time as he delivered his debut album ""The Documentary"" on Aftermath/G-Unit records. It was a much hyped and much anticipated release. As it dropped universal praise was hefted upon The Game for the record that was sonically spectacular and showed a revived west coast. Lyrically some people hated on The Game for name dropping so much, I won't lie sometimes it's a little tiresome, but as an obsessive hip hop nerd I like to hear people rap about hip hop. Its fun to figure out the connections they are trying to make and in all honesty it's nice to know that at least one artist in this game actually knows his history and respects the architects of our culture.   Pretty quickly after the release it all started to fall apart. The Game and his boss at G-Unit, 50 Cent, seemed to already be on shaky ground before the release, but upon the release it seemed everything was all good internally between the two camps with 50's hooks all over the album along with several guest verses and Game's screams of ""G-UNIT!"" always keeping you aware of who was responsible for this project. Then all of a sudden it seemed it came crashing down. Game wouldn't ride with the Unit on their beef with Nas - he was out.   We didn't really care because those of us who already had the record saw the talent that the kid had and we had ""The Documentary"" to prove it. The record continued to grow and went on to sell an absurd amount of records. I got to say good on The Game because listening to ""The Documentary"" it's obvious he put a lot of work into this album and that it meant a lot to him. He likes to talk about his life and what he's been through to get to this point of releasing his debut record. He likes to praise his influences. But most of all he likes hip hop.   So as I look back at ""The Documentary"" almost 2 years later I can't help but feel what he's saying. It's the truth of that time in his life. Sure Game is cocky and seems confused and or lost with his life right now, but the one thing that he does know is hip hop and he knows how to write verses. If you don't have ""The Documentary"" you need this record if for no other reason to see a young man grow. Without ""The Documentary"" you will not understand ""Doctor's Advocate"" (which I'll write a review for sooner than 2 years!), the record that will prove he did grow up and doesn't need anyone's help, 50 or Dre (trust me I've heard it). ""The Documentary"" may not be a classic but it's damn good and deserves a place in not just your hip hop collection but in your music collection as this is an album that goes beyond the definition of genre and is just music at its simplest form."

The only dud is don't worry, game hardly raps at all on that track the rest are good, some are great, and some are classics!!(Higher, Put You On The Game, How We Do, We Ain't, Westside Story).  All in all an incredible debut album...I've already heard a track from games next album, The Doctors Advocate, and I can tell you he is not gonna have a sophmore slump..It's gonna be hot!

1,"Basically, I think they sold out on this soundtrack. Alot of the songs that are prominently featured throughout the movie are missing (for example, Sum 41's Makes No Difference, Mest's What's The Dillio, Bis' Detour (Do You Wanna Go My Way?)) and instead, we find alot of songs of which we simply hear clips of during the competition mixes. Now, if they had actually featured the mixes in their entirety, it would be different. But instead we are left with a bunch of, quite honestly, mediocre songs"
4,"AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is one of METALLICAS BEST ALBUMS...I DONT REALLY LIKE THE LYRICS IN BLACKENED THAT MUCH, I MEAN I LIKE THE SONG BLACKENED. ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRACKS IS EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!!

1,"I can't believe that I'm NOT ALLOWED to give this zero stars.  This band is garbage. The record is worse than garbage. It's septic sludge. The music is unoriginal, cloying and boring. The vocals are the most annoying sound I've ever heard. I wish the courts would gag and restrain this band. This band couldn't stop a war if they had a nuclear bomb.  Boycott"
5,"I'm one of those reviewers that rarely rates music that hasn't touched me in one way or another. So when I felt that I wanted to write a review for a Stevie Wonder album, I ended up struggling over which of his great releases I should review. I love ALL of his mid-seventies releases....most notably, ""Innervisions"", ""Fullfillingness..."", and, of course, ""Songs..."". I guess I finally decided to 'tackle' this one based on its historical significance to the art of Music. For one, Stevie was ""coming into his own"" as far as musical expression and social commentary within his songs. Other than the great Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye, Stevie was at the forefront of writing about the joys, pains, positives and negatives of Human exsistance on Earth...and he did it very well. Songs such as ""Village Ghetto Land"", ""Pastime Paradise"", ""Saturn"" and ""Have a Talk with God"" among others, were as powerful 'messages' one could experience through a set of speakers. Secondly, He was able to finally gain TOTAL control of his musical vision from Motown and Berry Gordy....even more so than Marvin had done with ""Whats Going On""...and this TOTAL control shows most prevelant on ""Songs"" than any previous release leading up to this one(IMO). There's certainly a little bit of everything on ""Songs""---- the joy of life on ""Isn't She Lovely"";  black man's contributions to evolution in ""Black Man""; World Love and Peace in ""I am Singing""; the joys and pains of childhood in ""I Wish""; Spiritual guidance in ""Have a talk with God""; Desperation in the World's Ghettos in ""Village Ghetto Land"" , and even some ""Props"" to Mr. Ellington in ""Sir Duke"". One could literally go on like this for every song on this double album....Yes, very moving, significant statements indeed! As for the actual music and musicians, they are ""all over the board"" here (and Stevie certainly plays his share of the instruments, however, not as exstinsively as past albums). Every musician involved in ""Songs"" played exactly what each track called for, and, at the same time, still managed to put their 'mark' on these great cuts. The listener will be happy to find mellow, introspective songs...Upbeat, funky rockers...Spanish-tinged music....and even Stevie's brand of Fushion (Contusion)... Overall, A wonderful assortment of musical styles and genres mixed into one of the most important double LPs ever released. As a closing note, I am somewhat of a new-comer to this great artist, and yes, I am white. However, I feel this is one of a handful of artists that crosses/bridges ALL ethnic groups...weather black, white, yellow, or red. Please don't let the color of your skin (or Stevie's) stop you from experiencing some of the most important 'Art' ever produced. Strongly recommended, along with any other releases from this Genius"
1,"Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star).  But it's quite called for here.  CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!    Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album.  Average production.  Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content.  The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.  An amateur job all around.  It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape.  There's definitely growing pains all throughout.  Skip to his later selection"
2,"Reason for my rating is the fact I only got one cd.  I mean, 51 bucks for one cd is messed up.  I guess I bought it after reading the reviews hoping the cd had like a bonus disc inside that they didn't put on the description... oh well.  If you got the money and would like to own atleast ONE of the cd of this album, buy it"
2,Not the type of music I had envisioned...much slower than I was hoping for.
2,"don't just automatically hit ""not helpful"" because you unconditionally love sufjan, think about it. these are b sides, and more of the same. problem with sufjan is, he's brilliant, but not exactly varied. he's beginning to ape himself over and over again with similar time signatures, arrangements, and all slowly evolving towards the charm of a book report. Would like to see Sufjan stop the cloying/cutesie states project and sing about something personal to himself rather than the construction of a ferris wheel in Illinoi"
