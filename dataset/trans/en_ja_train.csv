2,"This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed."
1,"This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber"
1,"Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.  The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!"
1,"Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all"
1,"I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again"
1,"When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation"
2,This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: &quot;Lisa de los ojos azules&quot;. I wouldn't buy this CD without that song
1,"I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.  There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like ""Swim"": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire."" Or the artistic suicide of the last track, ""X-Girlfriend"", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between ""Machinehead"" and ""Glycerine."" The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building."
1,There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother
2,"I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.   My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that ""very best of"" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.   Some reviewers are saying there's ""heart and soul"" all over this album?  That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.   As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very ""modern"" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.  Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new ""very best of"" collection)"
1,Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..          
1,When will amazon allow a zero stars rating????
1,"If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks"
2,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies."
2,"I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.    I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much ""pop"", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about ""different"", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.    Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called ""keyboard solo"" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.    I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.    Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from ""good"" to ""great"".    Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)"
1,"Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers"
2,"Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.   Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (""Encore"", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).   D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here"
1,"After hearing ""I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)"" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa"
1,"First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable   This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing"
1,I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back
2,"This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves."
1,"Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.   "
1,"If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately"
1,"This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping"
2,"I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it.."
2,"Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.  Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song ""I Fought Piranhas"".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times."
1,"There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. ""Songs of Judy Garland"" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what ""look"" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of ""makeover"". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to ""Liza Minnelli"" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't"
1,"I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime"
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever."
2,"This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness"
2,"Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums"

2,"The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.   Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like ""Terribile lo Sento"", and ""Orribile lo Scempio"", ""GI'otraggi"" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic. "
2,"Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever"" on msn"

1,"I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either"
1,"i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's. this band was one of them. while yes, they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy, they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song.  i think they should have just did a ""da hui"" single with ""the noose"" and maybe ""cant get my head around you"" on it. this sucks really bad. it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album!! if you must hear, download or borrow.  please guys. quit or make good music. its pretty pathetic hearing ""hit that"" next to the godawful creed and nickelbland!!  so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by TSOL and The Damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this...a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless"
2,"As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.  Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.  Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit..."
2,"I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version"

And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury.

2,Don't think Dale can play a song the same way twice. Didn't like the selection of songs nor  the  way they produced. 
1,My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.

It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD

2,"Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what ""A Hard Days' Night"" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' ""Head"" than I was of ""A Hard Days' Night"".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to ""From Justin to Kelly"""
1,"Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television"
1,"This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2"" mark the sound of the ""rock water"" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this"
2,NOTHING NEW HERE.  I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton.  This cd is dull.  Suffering from Patton overexposure.  Maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album (Like Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizons)  rather than dozens of merely adequate ones
2,"When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style"
1,"on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went.  to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery.  if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. ""death letter"" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.  the rest is a waste of time.  the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd.  these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated.  go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain"
2,"There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy."
2,"i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though"
1,"The worst Christmas album I ever heard.  I just bought it, played it once, and will NEVER play it again"
1,"I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series"
1,Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere
1,"This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them"
1,"I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!"
1,"To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song"
2,"Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.   Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.  Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference"
1,Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money
1,"I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead"
1,"This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin"
1,"This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this"
1,"This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out"
2,"At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd.  At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.  To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.    If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.    I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, ""If the South Woulda Won,"" which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song. "
2,"I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it"
1,This never should've been pressed.  They should've taken the mix and thrown it out.  DO NOT BUY!!
2,"The singing is terrible on ""Fly Me To The Moon"".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings ""all I worship and adore"", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.  The rest of the pieces sound fine"
5,"I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang."
5,if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly mayby. Tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;V.I.C.E&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have
5,"I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like. My favorite ones are in order; Erotica Ray of Light Beautiful Stranger The power of goodbye Deeper and Deeper The prodution is excellent and I love the vocals. If your new to Madonna, my opinion would be to start here. But a true fan can give me lessons."
4,"As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a ""must-have"" for all Iron Butterfly fans"
5,"I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get ""Out Louder"", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought ""End of the World"" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.    THEN....I saw them PLAY.  You MUST see them PLAY!!  I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see them again!  It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's (""Out Louder"" and Scofield's ""A-Go-Go"" which they ""back"" him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this.  I'm like an ADDICT now!  I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house.  I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again.    I must say I like ""Out Louder"" and even ""A-Go-Go"" better than ""End of the World"", but only slightly.  It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few listens.  I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians"
1,"While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly ""note-for-note"" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close ""pop"" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey ""Masterpiece Theatre""-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week"
4,"I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else.   Though primarily focused on ""indie"" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies ""This Will Be Our Year"", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's ""Move On"",  Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic ""Sam Stone"", and the late Elliott Smith's ""A Distorted Reality..."", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the ""acoustic"" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's ""Everything's Ruined"" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of ""Date With The Night"" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause."
4,"It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s &quot;heydays,&quot; including the crank-it-up &quot;Gotcha&quot; (Starsky &amp; Hutch TV theme song) and soulful &quot;Shadows,&quot; among others.  I was disappointed more from &quot;Blow It Out&quot; wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott.  If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this.  Certainly worth $.."
1,"I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...  Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album ""Songs For Suicidal Lovers"", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: ""...aural film noir...delve into the dark side..."
5,"Prince's 1981 album CONTROVERSY is another classic album in his catalog. The title track is the standout immediately. This longer version than the single version features a prayer. The song is funky and effective. ""Sexuality"" is a great disco/funk number. ""Do Me, Baby"" is probably one of the sexiest songs he's ever done. This full length version is the one to hear. ""Private Joy"" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for ""Annie Christian"", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career"
1,"I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad."
2,"I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM.  However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over.  The entire album is pretty much ""blowing flowers out of your [rear end]"" types of songs. The title cut, ""Pictures"" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more.  It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote.  Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money"
4,"I have been ""making"" my kids listen to the music of TMBG for years, but I no longer have to ""make"" them listen.  My 6 and 7-year-olds actually ""want"" to listen to songs like ""No!,"" ""Clap Your Hands,"" and ""Four of Two.""  Although this is not TMBG's best CD (some say it is ""Flood""), this is my kid's favorite TMBG's CD"
5,"This CD will really grow on you. So listen to it several times before you make your final judgement. It is one of Van Morrison's best.  This CD appears to be almost Autobiographical at times. Especially STRANDED...JUST LIKE GRETA...THEY SOLD ME OUT. His Jazz background, his Irish background, his Blues  background...are all present on this CD."
2,"i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it"
1,"Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that ""hip-hop"" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45"
4,"Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three.  Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great.  These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade.  That's a good class to be in. "
1,"wow...i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe....i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003, but this is just overkill....relient k, academy is, everytime i die, from first to last, underoath, matchbook romance, saves the day are reasons not to support this tour(for all those people who go just to see NOFX, Casualties, and Time Again)...i REALLY give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around! this is worse than last year's by far....but what could you expect? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall...i mean the bands that are good on this aren't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40$ ticket to one of the shows. to me, that is a scam...im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a ""punk"" tour...i mean maybe if NOFX gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids, then maybe even those guys can see what hell this ""nu-emo"" trend is.  now, i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is, but i will say this....fans of warped 2003 and back...steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands(minus Time Again and Casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands)....some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit, but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe(brainless) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure.  all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy, simple plan, yellowcard, blink 182, good charlotte and new-school afi.  bottom line...avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better!......most likely it'll be worse, but hey, stranger things have happened"
2,"i gotta say I used to love this album back in the late 70's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really isn't as good as I remembered . . .they are quite loose, the songs don't stand the test of time, the playing not nearly as great as I remember it to be. . . surprisingly rough on groove. . . . not a true classic - i thought it wa"
1,"""With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. ""  ""Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit.""  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however"
5,"I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection."
1,"I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself. I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth"
1,"Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his ""fans"" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as ""music"".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. "
1,My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie
4,"OK I can't myself here, but this guy really listened to a lot Supertramp growing up or something.  I liked to album, but I can hear hints of Supertramp's style in about half the songs here in different degrees.  ""Bad Day"" probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the ""Breakfast in America"" album to me.  Still the album is enjoyable though, especially if you did like Supertramp.  I get the Leo Sayer hook, but I think it's off a bit.  Leo never used that many keyboards"
1,i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06.
1,The songs just did not get me dancing.  I have to say I was disappointed.  But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
1,I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album
1,"Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings ""Lips of an Angel"" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus! "
5,"This music so so wonderful.  It is very high energy and fun.  The kids don't really care that this a ""jazz"" album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy.  Don't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as ""kids"" music, get them something you can both enjoy.  Our favorites are the ""Doodle"" song and ""Potato Chips.""  Worth every penny and then some"
5,This is one of the best kid CDs I've heard.  The songs are all catchy and fun to listen to.  It's a great intro to jazz
5,"This was They Might Be Giants first major label album.  It continued, and expanded upon, the sound they had established on their independant label albums.  It's probably TMBG's most popular album.  It features many classic TMBG songs, like ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", ""Istanbul"" and ""Particle Man"".  It's chock full of the catchy melodies and silly lyrics that we have come to expect from the Johns.  A must have for all They Might Be Giants fans"
5,Our 22 mo. old loves this music much more than the kiddy tunes that mom and dad can hardly bear to listen to.
5,"Hot Hot Heat's Make up the Breakdown is a follow-up of Knock Knock Knock. Personally, if you're a big Hot Hot Heat fan, this will be one of your most favorite albums. Each and every song is unique and has catchy beats that will make you want to dance. The first song Naked in the City Again is great.  The second song, No, Not Now, is a popular tune that you can't help but start movin'. Get in or Get out has some of the most rad keyboarding parts. Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing. Oh Goddamnit is such an amazing song, with very fun lyrics so you're bound to sing along. The next song Aveda keeps many of us wondering: Ex-Girlfriend or Hair Product? Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt. Although very different from Hot Hot Heat's normal songs, In Cairo, is also a great song and adds a fabulous ending to Make up the Breakdown. This cd will be in your stereo for hours on end. The songs are addicting so this album is definately worth it's money. "
5,"Wonderful harmony, great voices, beautiful music.  This group deserves to be better known and to be hugely successful"
1,"The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.  I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's ""trained"" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.  Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.  My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help"
5,"St. Elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [and at times wistful] voice of Cee-Low and thought-provoking lyrics. I enjoy the variety of styles [from the frentic ""Go-Go Gospel"" to the introspective ""Just a Thought""]. A must-have purchase"
2,"the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of ""classic"". I assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i cannot see it as a gothic ""club"" material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i cannot find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would  i was very dissapointed in the whole cd. listened to a few songs here and there, if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past."
4,"Having left my Gothic Club mix CD at home, I decided to buy this one. What hooked me first was the live recording of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" by Bauhaus, which is classic Goth music. Some of the bands I liked, some I didn't, but all in all this is a great CD. My favorite is ""Sheryl"" on the second CD. This is a great CD for chilling, dancing, or showing the uneducated masses what Goth music really is"
2,"Tony Yayo's ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon"" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as ""Tattle Teller,"" ""Curious,"" and ""Project Princess."" For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as ""Live By The Gun"" and ""Homicide,"" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for ""harder"" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment"
1,"I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul"
4,"This album is a masterpiece by a legend who, at 65 years old, topped the charts. Dylan is an extroadinary talent and seems to get even better with age. Every song is exceptional and showcases his great talent and songwriting ability"
5,"I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a ""rock"" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a ""good"" song while Alex's delivery makes it a ""great"" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to ""get together"" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just ""meant"" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of ""Smooth"" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job."
5,"An outstanding set of kid's music with folk scene stalwarts such as Arlo Guthrie, Taj Mahal and Tim O'Brien joined by bluegrassers Tim O'Brien and Rhonda Vincent and blues pickers Keb Mo, Guy Davis and Eric Bibb, as well as Americana-country types such as Rosie Flores... An impressive lineup, sure, but better still is the calibre of songwriting, and the actual kid friendliness of it all.  This is a really fun album!  Fun, as in, little kids might actually like it, and might even sing along if you played it for them.  Plenty of silly songs like ""Bling-Blang,"" ""Bananaphone"" and ""Bellybutton Song.""  Some songs are perky, like ""Red, Red Robin""; others are instructive, like ""Man Named All The Animals,"" and others still model assertiveness and communication skills, like Taj Mahal's excellent ""Don't You Push Me Down,"" in which various kids stick up for themselves in unpleasant situations.  I like this album a lot, and plan to play it for my kid for years to come"
5,"You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr"
5,"In 1975, Joe Jackson was tired of Motown Records controlling his childrens' careers. So he moved them over to Epic Records. The newly Christened ""Jacksons"" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few.  They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, ""The Jacksons"" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with ""Enjoy Yourself"" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic ""Style Of Life"". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that ""Good Times"" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat"
5,"I am 68 and a long time Stewart fan, this is one of his best.  Don't know what the problem is with the other reviewers"
5,"What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in ""Power, Corruption Lies"" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.    The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for ""Blue Monday"" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  ""Age of Consent"" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also ""the Village""  is a great track as well.  If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!  -- Ted Murena   "
5,This CD is great for the entire family. The songs are catchy and it's not a big deal if you're caught singing them around strangers!
2,"I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's"
5,"I enjoy the album still to this day. All the songs are good, but I listen a couple of songs more than others such as Hold On, You don't have to worry, Don't Go.  This is a great album, which I don't planning on selling or trading anytime soon. "
5,The Crusaders Sound Great on this Disc.The Music&amp;Arrangements work very well all the way thru.The Grooves&amp;Smoothness make this Recording very Complete.this Group has been Bad for so long
5,"If it has the name Edwin McCain on it, trust me its a great product to buy. The songs he writes are heart felt and true to every drop of ink used to write them with.."
1,"Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.  If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.  Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately"
1,"I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree"
5,"Carbon Leaf's sound continues to evolve, and the results are outstanding. The band says it has given up trying to ""define"" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: ""Block of Wood"" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while ""International Airport"" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.  The songs range from engaging (""Bright Lights,"" ""Love Loss Hope Repeat"") to anthemic (""Learn to Fly,"" ""Comfort"") to heartbreaking (""Block of Wood"") to humorous (""A Girl and Her Horse"") to profound (""The War Was in Color""). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album.   There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.  This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with ""Ganging Up on the Sun"" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with ""Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat."
4,One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not  get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If  you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one  great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to  seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley
5,"This soundtrack is excellent. There is not a single song that I skip when listening to the cd.  The mix of recent and older songs sung by familiar and unfamiliar artists is great.  Anita Nalick, Breathe (2a.m.) is worth the price of the album."
5,"I haven't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there's online piracy? But I have to own this.  Feinstein's voice is so pure and versatile; he is funny at a moment and the next, he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet. His performance is first class, and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert.  "
4,"I have maybe a hundred Christmas CDs (it's a hobby) but I think this is the only one with the ""Explicit Lyrics"" warning!  This is fore just for one song ""Here Comes Fatty Claus"" which featured a fairly prominent use of the ""sh*t"" word.  I have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the CD without that song. She loves it!  As for the CD... it's pretty good. Waters has managed to collect the best of campy Christmas songs, something unique as far as I'm aware.    But it's not just a novelty CD... the songs are good. This isn't intentional camp... it is sincere stuff with MAYBE the exception of the Tiny Time song. (One of my daughter's favorite, because it's well done."
1,"As if Fiddy Cent wasn't enough to make me break some bones, this horrible trend of Kayne West comes in. What is there to be said that hasn't been said? Nothing, really; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers. All I have to say is that I hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later.  Want good rap? Go for Tupac (R.I.P.) or Public Enemy"
1,"Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty.  &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember"
5,"Dan Zanes is great! My husband and I both enjoy listening to this as well as our 20 month old. Most of the other music CD's that we have for our son I find a little irritating after a bit of listening. Rocket Ship Beach is fun, family music! I highly recommend this to all ages"
1,"Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In ""Preacher's Daughter"" he even says ""A preacher's daugher so she had common sense."" I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then ""Pass Me Over"" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. ""Sista Big Bones"" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this"
4,"Bubble from Ab Fab sounds exactly like Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and others.  What a talent.  She needs her own Las Vegas Show.  She would be beyond great!  "
5,"Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars."
5,"I'm one of those people who didn't really *know* anything about Beck.  Oh sure I knew his hits - ""Loser"", ""Where It's At"", ""The New Pollution"" et al.  Just never really thought much about the guy.  Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go...""E Pro"" and ""Girl"".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.  During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with ""Earthquake Weather"".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being ""meh"" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!  The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the ""Hey! Guero!"" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!  DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem"
5,"""Alt-country"" would indeed be a limiting description,none-the-less an accurate point of reference,as this artist is obviously drawing from past Country musicians.But make no mistake,this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.I'm usually more inclined towards the Heavy than the twangy,but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings,and this woman can SING.One of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation"
5,"After the profound impact of the David Rawlings produced ""O.C.M.S.,"" to my music collection, my pre-order of ""Big Iron World"" came with pretty high expectations. I've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it doesn't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of ""Wagon Wheel,"" ""Big Iron World"" does pull some wonderfully surprising punches. Though he doesn't capture OCMS's live act at it's fullest (and who really could), Rawlings' production once again manages to maintain OCMS's authenticity and pushes their ""old-time"" music into the modern area, without a hint of the tacky, over-produced, artificial, gimmicks, heard on other neo-bluegrass records.   ""Big Iron World"" is not an album stuck in history, or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past. With ""Big Iron World,"" OCMS once again displays its own sound, pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward, while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of Woody Guthrie, the picking of Muleskinner and the late 60's albums of Dylan. Moreover, the songs of ""Big Iron World"" comprise a complete body of work. The pro-union, ""Union Maid"" and folksy ""James River Blues"" are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole, with each song complementing the next. As with all of OCMS's albums, ""Big Iron World"" is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age.  They have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres."
5,"by far, Picture This, is my favorite cd from the JB collection...have three copies...one for the home, one for the car, and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts! Been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997...despite our daily hectic schedules, his music always brings us back to a place that is calm, relaxing & peaceful...now that we have small children, they are even accustomed to listening his music, which makes bedtime even sweeter! :)"
1,"You got to be kidding me right? People actually giving this album 5 stars. Wow people are so blind it isn't even funny. This is all commercialized garbage. E-40 is all on this ""hyphy"" tip now, lmao how wack is that. Hyphy is straight wack, the lyrics have no concept what so ever. All pointless.  Production, well yea all these commercialized albums got production, like this album. But then again where are the lyrics?   This is one of those albums where you sit there and like it ONLY because of the beat/hook lol. People that listen to this type of music dont like real Hip-Hop, as I said theyre blind. People that arent big Hip-Hop fans, I dont criticize you for listening, but all you people that claim to be Hip-Hop fans, f*** outta here, you aint.   This album is for commercial rap listeners only, if you like underground STAY away from this at all costs. Pick up some real HipHop instead.  Peace. "
2,"When I first bought this cd I really liked it, but unlike most other cd's it sounded worse with time. After 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and I found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the Killers. After seeing them live at the Virgin Festival this weekend I know they are totally phony, not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever. Do yourself a favor save your money on this one"
5,"When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert,      I like to listen to something quiet and soothing.  THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous ""Pizza boy"" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as ""background music.""  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.  By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)  I actually get the craving for pizza when I'm listening to the album.  The PIZZA TAPES sure is one tasty album. Great music and great pizza, what a winning combination!"
2,"Pls. Rick Nielsen, ""Tell Me Everything""! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's ""Mommy and Daddy"" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant!"
1,"I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon.  What a major disappointment this disk is.  Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good &quot;children's music&quot; inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk"
5,"I MUST SAY THAT WHEN I FIRST HEARD ""KICK PUSH"" I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT THIS GUY REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A METAPHORIC RHYMER AND HIS DELIVERY IS VERY STRONG SO I KNOW I HAD TO BUY LUPE FIASCO'S DEBUT ALBUM ""FOOD AND LIQUOR"". AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED BUT INDEED THIS ALBUM REALLY LET ME KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A FEW RAPPERS OUT THERE THAT ARE STILL KICKING RHYMES ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH IN EVERYDAY LIFE INSTEAD OF HEARING THESE OTHER MC'S THAT DONT RAP ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT CARS, CLOTHES, JEWELRY, AND WOMEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS A FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE THIS ALBUM WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS IN LIFE.  MY 5 FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: 1.""THE COOL""- THIS SONG IS BASICALLY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD DIED(NOT LITERALLY) BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE AND TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CHOSE TO LIVE HIS LIFE THE SAME WAY HE HAD LIVED IT ONCE BEFORE. SONG IS VERY METAPHOR AND DEEP. 2.""HE SAY SHE SAY""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESNT HAVE A VISIBLE FATHER AND IT IS AFFECTING HIM DEEPLY. 3.""HURT ME SOUL""- THIS SONG TALKS JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF FROM WOMEN BEING DEGRADED IN RAP MUSIC, DRUG DEALING, CROOKED COPS, GOVERNMENT NOT OFFERING BLACK PEOPLE WELFARE AND OVERCHARGING HEALTHCARE, JOHNS AND PROSTITUTES. SONG ALSO HAS A VERY NICE HOOK. 4.""SUNSHINE""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IN A CLUB EVENTHOUGH HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE HE CANNOT RESIST IT WITH THIS GIRL. 5.""PRESSURE"" FEATURING JAY-Z- VERY NICE CONCEPT TO IT FROM LUPE'S STANDPOINT AND EVENTHOUGH IM NOT A BIG JAY-Z FAN HE STILL PUT DOWN A NICE VERSE.  OTHER SONGS I LIKE ARE ""JUST MIGHT BE OK"", ""DAYDREAMININ"", ""KICK PUSH"", ""I GOTCHA"",""INSTRUMENTAL"", AND ""AMERICAN TERRORISTS"".  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL!!!!"
5,"I can't rate this one highly enough. It's certainly in a vein with his last couple, but, as has been oft noted, it's more political and full of social commentary. Some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones, as a result. I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs.  By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book ""Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music."" It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana. And Rodney shows up prominently throughout the book; there's a whole section just about this album"
1,"I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was ""Grind With Me"" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.  I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond ""Baby Blue"", and Slick -- and I use the term ""rapper"" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single ""Grind With Me"" is really called ""Grind On Me"", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but ""Playhouse"" isn't far behind. And ""Nothing But a Number"" is very, very statutory.  Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like ""If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right"" on ""Grind On Me"", or ""If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'"" on ""Grill `Em"" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like ""FROM THE BACK!"" on ""Get a Little Closer"", and ""Yes, sir!"" on ""Your Body"". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on ""Shorty Be Mine"" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.  Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on ""Never Let You Go"", ""Can't Live Without You"", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs ""Chevy"" and ""Grill `Em"". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of ""Your Body"", dammit, I'll beat it up.  Anthony Ruper"
5,"Wow...what a great collection of songs, a wonderful album. I am a fan of the Church, but even if you have never heard of them, you will find this disc amazing. I am at a loss of words to decribe the songs. My only regret is that there is not a DVD of performances of these songs. I would go upstairs and watch it all night"
5,Really well done. This is an extremely well crafted CD. Six Days is probably the best song on here.  Note: The song when they're waiting for bow wow's car is       Ooh Aah - Grit
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. "
2,"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just ""a little slow"" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and ""deep"", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty.     "
2,"I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2."
2,"I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation ""i'm your man"" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of ""if it be your will"" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. ""If It be your will"" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. ""mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ."" or ""i am so very happy, so please hit me"" or ""river of sorrow, don't swallow"" or the breathy way he says the word ""twilight"" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says ""if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people"". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved ""if it be your will"" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort."
2,"Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him"
1,"I don't care what others stated...Sabata rushed the opera to fit the LP capability, Maria screamed at all times, no pianissimis, and everyone was super high charged like they must finish the recording on time to fit the album.  Best Tosca is Maria Callas with Pretre recording.  Don't buy this mono recording.  Maria did not understand who Tosca was during this moment"
2,"Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me.  A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying.  Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad.  I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.    But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible.  They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.  Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times"
1,"perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched"
5,I love this new CD from Amos Lee.    The first single is entitled Shout Out Loud.  This song really puts me in a great mood.  His guitar playing is so energetic here.  My favorite track is Long Line Of Pain though.  It is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness. Sympathize is an another highlight on this disc.  Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck.  Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the  charm of a girl from the south.  Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one.  Freedom is an interesting track.  It is a reminder that the pursuit of  freedom should not lead to violence.  The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special.  Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend.  I love the feeling of loss and sense of  hurt in Amos' voice on this track.   Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer
2,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD"
5,"Once again, Audra McDonald proves that she's the best musical theatre singer since Streisand. While many fans might quibble with her selections (mostly covers of rock and pop songs), her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none"
2,"Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector.  The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable.  Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off.  Even Robin's latest redition ""A Live CD"" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies.  And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family.  Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers.  So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.  A devoted listener talisman, Dundee "
1,"The Black Eyed Peas are the WORST group is rap HISTORY! Its hard to believe that anyone could make music worse than the Black Eyed Peas. This group is an embarasment to Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and any other type of music ever created. How and why people continue to support these lame, extremely non-talented rejects of the rap world is completely unbelievable. I thought thier last CD was trash, but this has incredibly surpassed the low mark set by Elephunk, which should have been called, ""Hey let'sell out and attempt to create the worst music ever known to man"". The only good news is that theyll soon be forgotten about as they have just murdered thier musical careers, and will have to resort to doing jingles for commmercials in order to survive. These three unoriginal, talentless, boring, annoying, sellout, fake wanna-bes should stop making ANY kind of music and get completely out of the music business. Tonight I willl pray very hard that these bafoons of the music industry NEVER make another song EVER!!!! To say that they SUCK would be a compliment, they would have to practice constantly for the next 1,000 years THEN make a deal with the devil just to scrape up enough talent to suck! Theyre just that HORRIBLE!!"
1,"Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as ""Ray."").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie ""Ray.""  And to anyone who says that he can write good songs, let's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics:   Yo you sleep  Naw I just um, I think I want some more  Yea I know we just got through  But its just so good, I just caint help it tho'  Its something about your body  Naw it aint all I think about  Well to be honest, oh   Im startin' to believe,  Something's wrong wit me,  Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute  I'm thinkin' `bout it  I can be at my job, in my car, up in church  And when I try to pray it off, it won't work  It seems that I caint get enough of   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Its getting to the point where I (where I)  I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs  Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)  I aint proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me  And I caint help it, caint shake it  (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Some call it bad, some call it good  Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood  I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh   Some like it slow, some like it fast  It don't matter the tempo long as it lasts  I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh    -Wow, that's a big pile of garbage!  Lyrics like that should easily win him a Grammy.  Keep it up, Jamie! "
2,"There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow ""Singin in the Bathtub"" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time"
5,"Like all of Antony's Music, this EP has a chilling and superhuman quality to it. Unlike his other stuff, the production is toned down on the non-album tracks (""The Lake"" and ""The Horror Is Gone"") to a stark, white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of Antony & The Johnsons. The album track, ""Fistful of Love"", is one of my favourite Antony songs, a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish.  Though the price is a bit steep, this is a great addition to any Antony fan's library"
4,"I am not a CLAY-MATE... howver, Clay Aiken is without-a-doubt the best runner-up from any season of AI.  That being said...I still wasn't sure if I would like this CD.  And I didn't---at first.  But then, after hearing it a few more times, I actually grew to like most of the songs.  Not all of them, which is why I didn't give him 5 stars, but it is a very good album.  My favorite happens to be the title track.  But, there are several more good songs on the CD.  Whether or not you are into this style of music, you can't argue that Clay Aiken has one of the best male voices around.  Probably the best male voice of his age.  I would recommend this CD to any one who is into Adult Contemporary.  Of course, if you are a Clay-mate, then I don't have to tell you anything :"
1,"As a big fan of the Postal Service (their ""Give Up"" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)""Last Songs"" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service"
4,"This is a very different sounding Paul Simon album.  The influence of Brian Eno is obvious and at times over-the-top.  My conclusion, now that I've had this album for a while, is that it's not one that I'm constantly listening to but, when I'm in the mood, this is really an interesting and fun album.  Occasionally, Paul reaches heights I don't feel he's reached since Graceland.  There are some great songs on here.  If you're looking for ""Still Crazy after all these years"" or ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" - type songs, you're not going to find them here.  If you're interested in hearing Paul push the envelope, however, this is the one.  Paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one"
1,"I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the ""look at it a week from now and see how you feel"" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it."
2,"I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art.  People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages.  They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks.  Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears.  To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.    I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.  Creative; maybe.  Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no"
1,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience"
1,"Boy, and I thought ""Cats"" was bad. This is the single most boring, stupid, pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears. There is no story line, no range in music, no feeling, no lyrics to back up the awful music. I mean, the list could go on forever. I warn you, it's the biggest waste of $25.00 that you might, no, will ever spend. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and trust me. DON""T BUY THE CD!!! And if you do, when you put it on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.You've been warned. Now please, spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life"
5,"If you like this album, if you like the title track, it might inspire a few hard core fans to know that the original inspiration for both the name of the band, and especially the title track, is the masterpiece of a western, ""Bad Company""- 1972.  The whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film's soundtrack, by ""Fantasticks"" Harvey Schmidt.  The song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until I saw the film itself.  It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges.  It's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination, but to fans of the band itself, to help make the song more meaningful, as it has for me!!  I highly recommend them both"
5,"I have held back from doing an online review because I recognize that my objectivity isn't well, very objective when it comes to Elton John.  I love everything he does (even ""Victim of Love""!).  But I could no longer resist.  This CD is magnificent.  Elton John and Bernie Taupin have crafted a work that spans generations, bridges gaps and even pays homage to personal and artistic lapses over the years.  It is an honest, courageous and celebratory reflection of the terrain these two geniuses have traversed over some 37 years.  That's the depth of ""The Captain and the Kid.""  But let's not get lost in the depths here, either.  This CD is one great listen.  Even if you're not interested in the history...even if you're just a casual fan (can one just be a casual Elton John fan??)  or just like good music, ""The Captain and the Kid"" is great entertainment.  It has it all...great arrangements, great piano playing from Elton and of course, hooks abound.  No one...that's right, no one can write a hook like Elton.  These songs stay with you...they become your companions on YOUR journey, and like good wine, they get better and better.  I must also write a word of support for all who have written regarding so many artists doing retreads of old standards/hits.  I know, I know, this stuff is selling like there's no tomorrow.  I suppose, as much as I can't bear another Rod Stewart retread CD ( I loved Rod though most of his career...I just can't stand what he's done over the last five years...Rod...please STOP!) I guess the attraction/appeal of these CD's is that the buyer knows they're going to get a full CD's worth of good (or at least known) songs from a reliable artist.  True, it is not as easy as it used to be to find many CD's today that are original and good from start to finish...CD's tend to be longer than LP's and therefore run the risk of running out of steam, and let's face it...many do. Oh, the classic CD's, they're out there, you might have to do some mining before striking gold, however.  Sadly, ""The Captain and the Kid"" did not ignite the charts.  I cannot understand it. And I do realize that popularity has nothing to do with greatness. Yet, this IS truly a great CD, a work of art that deserves to be heard.  It is a throw back to the glory days, yet it is not dated in the least. And one listen...just one puts you right back on the yellow brick road, platform shoes and all! No, I suppose you can't go back...not totally anyway, but it is oh so nice take one more sweet ride with The Captain and the Kid. "
1,Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others
2,"Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut ""Lucky To Know You.""  ""Seeing Through You"" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like ""Lucky To Know You."" "
4,"Be Human does not disappoint! It has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when I say 4stars I mean it. When I say 5stars I usually mean a ten. Were I to do sound for a futuristic play I would feel gratified in using some of this. I think Yoko Kanno knows the Secret of Life and she shares her formula...with us, time-and-time again. I happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces; but if I had to choose american rhythm or Yoko Kanno, I would choose Yoko Kanno. I wonder if she's ever been nominated for a grammy? In my book she's world-class!As-I-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify  four-stars. No worries here"
5,This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio
1,This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.  He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.  I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable
2,"I have always liked R. Kelly's music.  When he produced ""Trapped in the Closet"", I thought it was a joke.  This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard."
2,"Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  ""Get Your Hustle On"" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  ""I Know You Know"" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  ""Around The Way"" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  ""Sets Go Up"" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single ""Rodeo"" is the millennium version of ""Back That [...] Up"" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  ""What's Happenin'"" is nothing to write home about, ""Loose Booty"" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and ""Break A Brick Down"" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. ""Who's Ya Daddy"" is pointless, along with the annoying ""Keep Talkin'"" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and ""Why Not.""  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on ""Rock Like That.""  The biggest shocker has to be ""Addicted"" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of ""The Rain."")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come. "
2,"There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.  Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.  The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).  Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).  P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter. "
1,"BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!!"
1,"I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song ""Good is Good"" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned ""crimes"" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some ""SOUL."" Peace"
1,"And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of ""covers"" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' ""First Utterance,"" the Incredible String Band's ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" or Shirley Collins' ""No Roses"" instead"
5,"This album showcases Collin Raye's amazing tenor to the fullest. Hits like ""Love Me,"" ""Little Rock,"" ""My Kind of Girl,"" ""Not That Different,"" and ""I Can Still Feel You"" are featured on this brilliant album. Raye's vocals are well done, as is the song selection. Most of the songs are ballads, Raye's specialty. If you are a fan of Collin Raye, then this album is a must-have."
1,"I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a ""hip hop teeny bopper"". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should"
5,"Though Dylan and the Band had played together a lot before this record (the Basement tapes and the 1967 tour), this is the first recording of them together that was released and I must say the Band's playing on this record is vastly different than those times, different than the live ""Before the Flood"" as well. I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work. Love songs, dirges, uplifting songs, tough songs and torch songs, this is a record for the ages. Yes, it was overshadowed by ""Blood on the Tracks,"" but it's been years now and still ""Planet Waves"" stands the test of time. I really like this record"
1,"Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style."
1,"Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why ""remake"" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to ""No More Kings"" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!"
1,"Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this"
1,"What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review"
5,"If you are looking for just a general overview of Iggy's career, I'd say this is a pretty good way to go.  It contains a bit of music from each section of his career"
5,"This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the ""Titanic"" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: ""National Treasure Suite"" (Track 1). The Tracks: ""Library of Congress"" (Track 4), and ""Declaration of Independence"" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: ""Spectacle Discovery"" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money"
5,This CD is a must have if you are a Hot Boys (Old school Cash Money) fan
2,"...don't buy this CD.  Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy.  There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan.  It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well.  The upsides to this compilation are as follows:  one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive.  However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all"
1,How can they even call this punk. Were's six feet under or slayer. Maybe some cibo matto. These are the bands they need to add....... Not yellowcard and other crummy emo band
2,"RBX is one of my favorite rappers, he has a dark, sinister style. Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me"
4,"Seth Maheu ""College Student""....your high. remedy is probably the song i like LEAST on this album. i hate it. the rest of the songs are awesome though, my favs are ""because of me"" ""world falls away"" ""tongue"" and ""simplest mistake"". this cd is a solid effort.  and seth, you know Ef all about music. the fact u like remedy the best, and suggested that anything by lloyd banks is worth buying shows you have terrible taste. Jurrassic 5 are good, but ""amazing lyricism""?? no. jurrasic 5 are good because they are fun, and keep the forumla simple and old school. true hip hop. but there are LEGIONS of more talented emcees.   dont EVER say anything about lloyd banks again. he is terrible and makes outdated, gangster BS. he should get over himself and stop furthering the stereotypes everyone has of hip-hop. hip-hop has a terrible name becuase of losers like him, 50, ja, and eminem (yeah he USED to be good).  BUY THIS SEETHER ALBUM"
1,I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful.  The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah.  I don't recomend this at all.  If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better
2,"There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.  Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.  Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!  Why are the vocals so ""hot""?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.  Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.  Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.  Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.  It's vintage, but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast"
2,"That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better"
5,"Absolutely great collection of Alan Jackson's best, without the filler.  A must-have.  By the way, is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that Alan Jackson's ""songwriting skills need work""?!"
4,"In 1987 Barry, Robin, and Maurice were reunited! Or at least that's how new distributor Warner Brothers tried to sell it.  Even though the brothers never really left themselves or us, but  I digress.  I only have this album on cdr, since Warner's seemed to make the release very scarce.  The cover is cool, though.  The boys look totally different from when audiences remembered them last. No white, no hair, well not as much anyway.  Black. Dark, edgy.  I'm Pip and I've come to play!          ESP is naturally the song to lead off the album.  It is different from any other project the Brothers did at the time.  Better than Walls Have Eyes, more polished than Now Voyager.  However, ESP is also very stand alone on this album and nothing else here sounds like it.  (Not that I mind that of course.)  We heard some of Robin's coming out voice party on Living Eyes, but in songs shared with Baz.  Barry moved onto some heavy producing, but without Robin.  ESP brings them together again and slams both powerhouses.  There is so much going on in this song, you can imagine this is what a telepath hears. Noise, each trying to have its own say, competing with everything else that is heard, and all of it's important.  Brilliant.          Ah, You Win Again.  Although not as well know in the US as the Fever Monsters, this song is indeed one of those monster songs that you just have to love.  There are so many hooks, lines, and sinkers musically, lyrically, vocally. From the whole second verse's play on `Nobody stops this body' to Robin's Oh Baby! wail to that bombing drum throughout.  Hot damn.  This song did actually even encroach the US charts, imagine that!         Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)  (What is it with them and parenthesis?) is the first slow song presented.  Barry returns to his shrill notes and sometimes the versus are tough to understand.  The chorus is strong and the lyrics as always are top notch.  The ad-libbed over the top ending is perfect eighties power ballad fashion.  The music and high voices are a little dated, but you can't help but try and sing along when your driving home alone late at night, or is that just me?          Giving Up The Ghost  sound a bit more like the tracks on Walls Have Eyes, but that's ok. Great music rifts.  Some of the refrains are a bit much, and one of the times where I might say the chorus is the weaker part of the song. Then again, the boys hold out `Ghooooost!' and it sounds cool again.  Robin sounds great in the verses, since you can understand him seventy percent of the time.  ;0)        The Longest Night is one of the hotter Bee Gees songs in my opinion, just like Bodyguard.  After their solo and side projects in the early eighties, the brothers came back for ESP stronger again.  Robin with this song has somehow managed to combine the weeping Joke sound with the booming voice he developed post Fever.  The vibrato was always there, but the five o'clock shadow eighties sounds fit Robin's haunting lyrics as the sixties mellow sound did.   Indeed ESP together with Walls Have Eyes is a dang good hunk of Gibb material that it seems everyone missed. Pity.          Every album has to have a fun song and This Is Your Life is ESP's.   It's nice to see the Brothers come back and kind of laugh off and yet embrace their past music.  The lyrics `line-drop' titles of other Bee Gees songs during the interlude.  Can I tell you this is the only time I sing to `JJJive Talkin'!  It's Barry rapping but with dribs and drabs from the old songs cutting in and out. Very cool.  I could recommend the entire album on that interlude alone if I had to, but I don't.         Outside of its sweet and soft lyrics and vocals, Angela  is in my mind a little bit of a statement song.   Sometimes it feels like you can almost exchange `Angela' for `America'.  Followed by the line `I'm still alive', I wonder if the boys were making a veiled statement at us stubborn Yanks.  Indeed they were still alive, and maybe this is also a pun on Stayin' Alive. The New York times effect a man, remember.  ;0)  The feel of the song is so innocent and easy feeling, but I suspect more!  The girl that got away? I think not.          Maurice brings this album to a standstill with Overnight.  It's the closest in vein to the song ESP.  Maurice, however, adds not telepathy, but animal magnetism.  It's a different kind of psychic sense.  The lyrics  are so detailed and the interlude combining the echo of all three voices is exceptional.  The music has, if there is such a thing, a predatory feeling that's good.  By the end of the song you are totally sold and yelling back, ""All right I'll stay!""         In the eighties and later on High Civilization, The Brothers seem to have a little Motown tribute revival thing going. Crazy For Your Love is fascinating in that it is has a Motown throwback vibe and at the same time, it's straight eighties bubblegum pop.  (Tiffany, anyone?)  I would cringe if I heard some tween today singing any song about love and ice cream .  However, play Crazy for a kid today, they will like it, and never know it is old men singing in 1987!  How ingenious is it to find such a timeless song here?!         Backtafunk  is not your traditional Gibb song.  It sounds a bit...I want to say New Edition! Naturally the brothers master all the hip beats and singing, even if the lyrics are slightly bland.  Again however, the breakaway interlude makes the song.  The harmony and fun of the boys come in and the song kicks up to another level.  Is Barry scatting? Incredible!         ESP ends with the ESP Vocal Reprise, and I don't really know why.  Its  just the opening echo of the voices on the first track, but it does sound cool. Allow me to mention the oddities associated with ESP, as you knew there would be some! Young Love is an unreleased cut that didn't make the album.  I managed to download a piece that cuts short, but it's heavy in the low key Maurice vein.  Honestly I don't know why it was cut.  The 1989 compilation Tales From The Brothers Gibb contains an ESP Demo that is very similar to the final version, just missing a few production marks.  Fans should also check out The One For All Tour VHS and DVD for concert footage of the boys singing Giving Up The Ghost and extras from One.          Warner Brothers does not realize The Bee Gees quality they possess, and they should re-release ESP.  I wonder if this album planned to have any sort of theme to it? Each song touches a different type of emotion and vibe, and aren't songs in a way a psychic connection from one person to another? Interesting theory, Kristin. Interesting. "
1,"Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal.  I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad"
1,"I was just speechless when i first heard this. What was known as the best heavy metal band on earth 10 years prior, has become a lion without balls or teeth. Country-influenced tunes!? Slow, blues-influenced songs? NO way, NO thanks.  Also a very overrated album. The Black Album was OKAY but 3 stars in my book..but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for Metallica.PS: The Memory Remains and Unforgiven 2 are HORRIBLE SONGS."
5,"These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever"
5,"OK...there may be alot of songs on here that you don't know from her Hollywood films, but don't let that stop you.  She is marvelous and fun!  Another reviewer said they were disappointed with this...ignore them and buy it"
5,"The music in this musical uncannily remains faithful to ABBA music and the story line which was written to showcase the music.  I saw the Las Vegas production, not the the original London production yet the music sung and played in the LV production was just as fantastic as that within the original production. If you like ABBA,(and who does not?) and cannot spring for the price of a ticket, this DVD is the next best thing"
5,My only regret was not getting this album sooner.  The music and lyrics are real and unpretentious.  Wayne Hancock is a true American gem
1,"let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks"
2,"Jerry, si estas leyendo esto: Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional. Te queremos mucho!!!  Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como la del tiempo de ""Cuenta Conmigo"", ""Cara de Nino"", y ""Magia""...  No te dejes influenciar por la musica que esta de moda hoy, el reggaeton no te va!!! No me malinterpretes: hasta tu disco ""Vuela muy alto"" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda. Seguire escuchando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno nuevo.  Vamos, por favor, te lo rogamos!!! Te quiere tu fan DJ LOLA, desde Montreal, Canada"
5,"""The Who Sell Out"" is one among ( at least 3 ) several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.  1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album ""Armenia in the Sky"". The outstanding single ""I Can See For Miles"" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.   The acoustic ""Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand"" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.  Songs like ""Odorono"" and ""Tattoo"" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.   ""Our Love Was"" and ""I Can't Reach"" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album ""A Quick One"".   I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.   Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic ""Sunrise"" is quite beautiful, but ""Rael"" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.  Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.   Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals."
5,"This album demonstrates the musical mastery of the legendary Who. It's also interesting how today's groups like Green Day and Limp Bizkit don't even close to the Who. And to Orion, a reviewer on this forum, you're a sad case, my friend. I sincerely hope that you successfully seek out the psychological help that you so desperately are in need of"
1,"The Who don't have any talent. They are overrated, and only made 1 decent song in Wont Get Fooled Again. Avoid this lousy compilation and get Dire Straits Making Movies insted"
4,"I was introduced to MCR through Three cheers for sweet revenge, which is one of the best albums to ever be released. I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love is a very, very good release. All the songs are awesome, and the intensity and ferocity that drew me MCR in the first place is well in place on this album. But, it seems that they were still finding their sound and direction on this album. Very good album, but the recording is very raw, semi-okay production. But nevertheless a great release that you must check out...My favorite song is Drowning lessons"
1,how all yall fools gonna come up in here calling this trash gangsta.. Kali is where the real ridas live and die notthe dirty.. DIRTY... south or the LEAST coast.. everyone since the mid 90's has bitten the west coast and this is no exception.. tha frontlinerz have a track called ''gangsta in me'' and they put it right on these so-called gangsta's callin themselves trap ni66az.. this is a joke.. like everything else and whoever said this isnt commercial.. give it up.. this record is sitting on wal-marts shelves!!! i heard this and had one serious laugh.. boyz n da hood... another example of how you suckers bite the west..
4,"Few people are aware that Dave Thomas, in addition to being the founder and spokesman of the Wendy's hamburger chain, was also the leader of Pere Ubu. Clearly Mr. Thomas wasn't in it for the money, since he made his fortune selling good old-fashioned hamburgers, and so he was free to pursue his own musical muse. The results are sometimes splendid, sometimes things go awry, but it's always the unique stylings of Dave Thomas that characterize this raw, passionate music. Kinda makes you wonder what would have happened if Carl Karcher, founder of Carl's Junior, had also pursued music with such abandon and freedom from financial considerations"
1,"It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was ""Today"", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was ""Disarm"" which I hated from day one, and the same with ""Cherub Rock"". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is ""Mayonaise"" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's"
1,"This CD is a total misrepresentation.  MANY of the songs are VERY poorly done concert versions of songs.  They even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs.  Buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection.  Don't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits.  14 songs are live.  One appears to be re-recorded.  The rest are the originals.  Also, on CD #2 many of the media tags are incorrect.  When you play ""All I Really Need Is You"" (Live) the title ""Heartbreak Hotel"" shows.  When you play ""Headed for the Future"" the song title ""All I Really Need Is You"" shows.  When you play ""Heartbreak Hotel"" the song title ""Headed for the Future"" shows.  Overall, a VERY sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality"
2,"As a well-educated rock music,especially emo-punk,person,I was sickened every time i tried to listen to this CD all the way through.Why? It's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever (not completely horrible,though)and the fact that this band is led by a singer who shouldn't be bragging about his ""musical genius"" when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers,isn't sweetening the deal.When i bought this album,it had a sticker on it that read:""If you like Taking Back Sunday,Brand New and The Used,you'll love Matchbook Romance!""I should have known how desperate they were when i read that.But more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to Taking Back Sunday? TBS is actually an emo band that doesn't sound recicled.And Brand New?Have they heard Deja Entendu?That album is not only the best emo album,but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre"
5,"I'm afraid Alfonso Lozada has missed the point. The film is about a span of time in the life of one person, Tony Wilson, and is thus structured around his experiences. At the same time, the film is not a documentary but a fictionalized account. On top of all this, the &quot;Tony&quot; character does mention the short shrift the Stone Roses get. Is it really a surprise to find the soundtrack album bereft of artists which did not appear in the film"
4,"For me, there have always been those bands where I like them but can only listen to a few of the songs because of the lead singers voice. This would include Maroon 5, Billy Talent, and Clap Your Hands Say Yea. While I applaud these bands for being unique, it is hard to listen to an entire cd of it. Hot Hot Heat is one of the only exceptions I have ever had. I can listen to their cd's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track. While anything can become irritating, it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me. I am also not a huge fan of these new English bands like Snow Patrol and Arctic Monkeys, but yet again Hot Hot Heat has something that just sticks with me. I recommend this cd as well as Make Up The Breakdown. Very good, upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home"
5,This is the best R&B female album out this year. I listen to this CD all day. Although it has 10 songs like the other chick... Monica has something to say and relates to many women out there. I love this CD. My favorite is Hell No. If you have not done so go and get this immediatley especially if you wasted your money on BDay like I did
5,"Well Crossfade may just be another modern rock Alt Metal band but that doesn't make them bad. Sure, they don't really add anything new to the music out now but that shouldn't take away from the music itself. All I know is from what I heard they have some really good tracks. I first heard the track ""Cold"" on the radio and it was just one of those songs that I love instantly. I just had to go out and get the album. After getting the album It turned out to be pretty good. I pretty much enjoyed everything on here. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be ""Cold"", ""Starless"", ""Colors"", and ""Dead Skin"". Here's the track ratings...  1. Starless - 9.5/10  2. Cold - 10/10  3. So Far Away - 9.5/10  4. Colors - 10/10  5. Death Trend Setta - 10/10   6. The Deep End - 9/10 7. No Giving Up - 9.5/10 8. Dead Skin - 10/10 9. Disco - 7/10  10. The Unknown - 9/10  Overall: 93% A-  Sure, it's not really anything new but It is good and a nice listen. I enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what Crossfade has done with their new album that was just released. Anyway, anyone who's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection. "
4,"Out of Exile, like the debut, rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore. Again we see Rick Rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock. Chris Cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics. Indeed the fact that Cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over. Lucky for us that they did.  This second instalment of the Audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing. The riffs are so smooth - who let the 70's back in? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff. This album does fell a little mellower overall. Not sure if that's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut.  This ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up. Sure it's sales weren't up there with the debut but it's as consistent as the first album and it's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there. In the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along.  Token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover"
5,"The movie is awesome, but the cd is equally amazing.  Awe-inspiring, from quiet, peaceful music to the full orchestra in the finale at the end, this is one of the best soundtracks ever written!  A great gift to yourself or friends"
2,"I absolutely loved that song ""Carry On Wayward Son"" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars"
4,"This is a somewhat interesting exploration of language, semantics and rhythm.  It is more surreal in it's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts.  Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, ""An Animated Description of Mr. Maps"" for a very clear example of such.  While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation.  Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring"
1,"Knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of Dire Straits. Perhaps he is attempting to be Mr. Atkins reincarnate, but if that is the case then he should  buy the white shoes and move to Florida. Simply put, a terrible album with little to recommend it."
1,"I feel sorry for those who thought this was more great YES-Jon Anderson Christmas music.  I'm one of the few fortunate souls who actually found a 3 Ships CD after it was out of print.  Paid some $30+ for it, but worth every penny.  Too bad ripping and passing out mp3's is illegal, because I'd share!  Add my name to the ""Bring Back 3 Ships!"" petition"
5,"On What's Left of Me, Nick Lachey sings about lost love and heartbreak for they whole duration of the CD.  This is his version of No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom CD.  Every song is about a broken relationship.  The Lyrics are very good and the songs are also very well done.  Don't buy this CD if you are looking for his SoulO upbeat fluff.  The tone of this CD is sad.  Most of the songs are ballads.  But not slow ballads more like pop rock power ballads.  He has a great voice.  It is strong and has a great tone.  Out of every boy-bander I have ever heard I would say he has the most talent.  Not only is his voice strong but it is also great because he sounds like a man not a girl, (i.e. Justin Timberlake).  The stand out tracks are: I Can't Hate You Anymore, On Your Own, and Beautiful.  The rest of the songs are good too.  This CD finally makes him a legitimate music star"
2,"I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd"
1,"The show rocks, the soundtrack sucks. I didn't recognize any of the songs from the show, that alone tells you how memorable this soundtrack is. Dismal and dissapointing :"
1,"I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the ""my life sucks"" and ""everyone hates me"" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD"
2,"Kate Bush's second album, ""Lionheart"", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing ""The Kick Inside Part Two"", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.  Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (""In Search of Peter Pan"", ""In the Warm Room""), a more pop structure (""Wow""), rhythmic shifts (""Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake"") an almost shuffle (""Fullhouse"") and a gret rock song (""Hammer Horror"").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (""Symphony in Blue"") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (""Kashka from Baghdad"").  The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing ""Kashka from Baghdad"" can be all that bad, and certainly ""Symphony in Blue"" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut (""The Kick Inside"") or the stunning ""Never For Ever"""
2,"this CD is not good.  Luckily, I only paid 5 bucks for the used copy.  I mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs?  I don't.  The couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets 2 stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves.  Bruce really took a page from Gene's book here and went after the money.  Should be an EP and nothing more"
2,"This cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced. Any 1999 cd should have better sound quality. Like the other reviewers stated,i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately 1 minute long each.Gotta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer. They could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators. Curiously too,where is the NWO's music"
1,"Painful to hear and painful to watch.  A yester-year pop singer who doesn't have the courage to quit.  There is nothing left to do so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album to stay in the spotlight; if that isn't the highest form of egoism I don't know what is.  She's got fame she's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please?  What she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic.  The woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance.  She uses anything from sex to religion to self promote.  Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.  I challenge Madonna to put on a concert without all the antics and overt sexual malarkey that dominates her shows; she would be booed right off the stage if that were to happen.  And please enough with the crucifixion stunts all ready.  "
4,This album is what the goo is all about.......they were at their BEST here!!!!!!!!!!  This was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again
1,"Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it."
5,"Bob is the King!  The KING!  Get this disc, you will dig it.  You can really sense the urgency in this CD.  Go to Bob's site, check out some of his notes on the Album.  If you can make to Austin, TX, spend about 2 weeks going to Bob's shows and you will understand.  From Joe Rockhead to Texas Bluegrass Masacre, Bob's the real deal, always pushing boundries, coming up with new sounds, un-corporate, straight ahead Rock and Roll"
5,"I'm trying to get everything he ever did, a real her"
5,Don''t waste anymore time in reading reviews.  Go and get this album
1,"I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down."
1,"bought this cd quite a while ago. it is probably very good, but how can i tell when it won't play on my stereo? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans. this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets. after buying the disc, i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says ""audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc."" WHAT A GREAT IDEA: SELL A DISC TO PEOPLE THAT WON'T PLAY FOR EVERYBODY. THANKS A..HOLES"
5,"I AM A TRUE SMOOTH JAZZ FAN AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST CD BRIAN HAS EVER MADE."" COME ON UP "" IS GOOD BUT ""NICE AND SLOW"" IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.LISTEN ONE TIME AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED I KNOW I WAS.                                   "
5,Nicholas Reyes has the absolutely perfect voice for this music...a fantastic collection of energetic rhythms to  keep you moving!!  
1,For a group that exudes such passion in their music (LIVE FROM BUFFALO anybody?) this song is like a funeral dirge. I can only hope that they haven't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are.  Take your time guys - let's get your BEST work.   T
5,"I rated this album 5 stars because it wouldn't let me do a 4.9 star. 3:16 was the perfect LP. This is very close. There is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with, Walk Like A Man, but still, the cd is one of the best yet.  Let me say this, I have 3 Murs CDs, The end of the beginning, 3:16, and now Murray's Revenge. This is the second best of the 3. Track 6, Dreamchaser, is definately worth putting on repeat all day. That is my favorite song on the cd.  All of the tracks on here are solid.   For someone trying to get a feel for Murs and his style, he uses a lot of samples in his beats like Kanye West, and his flow, well, hes in a league of his own. One of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time. He is not underground, but not big yet either. He deserves air time. His tracks aren't aimed for that like say, a Nelly or Little Jon.  All I can say is, Murs deserves to be one of the TOP emcees in the business. And in my opinion, he is, by far. It would be interesting to see a colaboration between Murs and say, Mos Def or The Roots.  All in all, BUY THIS CD"
5,"Bow Wow Wow is not a Household Name, They Charted Once in the USA with ""I want Candy"" (Top 50), and released only 3 Proper Albums...Their Sound is Tribal, the Lead Singer Annabella often Yelps to Percussive Drumming and throbbing Bass, The Mixture yields Many Great Tunes, but it can take getting used to, as it did for Me, I was not a Fan untill much listening...If You don't know a lot of the Group's Songs, I suggest listening to as many 30 second Samples as possible to get a feeling of whether this stuff is digestible...Most of the Songs here are first-rate, I particularly Love ""TV Savage"", ""Golly Golly Go Buddy!"" and ""Louis Qatorze"", along with Annabella's Solo Turn ""Fever""....If You want to explore further, I suggest the CD ""Girl Bites Dog: Your Compact Disc Pet"" to round out Your Collection, it includes more Gems, such as ""Sexy Effiel Tower"" (Where 14 Year-Old Annabella Pants Orgasmically...and more authentically than Donna Summer)and ""Radio G String"", as well as 3 Cuts from this CD in different versions; But begin here, and don't go further unless You Adore this CD...."
5,"One of my top fave Rasputina albums. Tons of great songs, very few joke songs, and great art work"
5,"I've been listening to Chris Cornell for about two years, after discovering him in Audioslave. Then I heard ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman"" and after that more or less forgot about Soundgarden. My friend lent me this CD one day and I forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well...Wow. First off, Chris Cornell has one of the strongest, most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it's amazing. These songs are all hard, raw, catchy, and all have a great guitar & drum sound. ""Outshined"" is probably my favorite Soundgarden song of all time. No rock fan should pass this up:  1. Rusty Cage-5/5-One of my favorite Soundgarden songs. It's fu**ing great; Chris Cornell hits some great notes too. 2. Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer! The chorus is catchy as hell. 3. Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-Chris Cornell has an awesome screaming voice. This song has some good lyrics, guitar solo is good, and Matt Cameron's drumming stands out. 4. Jesus Christ Pose-5/5-I don't know what this song is about, but it kicks  a$$. The music (guitar & drumming anyway) is really good. 5. Face Pollution-5/5-Great title, the song is OK. The shortest song on the album. I know I'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of Tool) is singing gibberish at the end. 6. Somewhere-5/5-The most harmonious song on the album, but there's still some ""screamage"". 7. Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-The opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating ""The devil sounds like this"" and then Cornell begins singing is great. Really good lyrics too. 8. Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-The music is good, but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music;  hence 4/5 9. Mind Riot-5/5-Easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs. Cornell sings the song perfectly. 10. Drawing Flies-5/5-Lyrics are good. 11. Holy Water-5/5-(No Comment) 12. New Damage-5/5-One of the best on the album. The album goes out with a bang!  "
5,"I have to say my fav songs are when Amy Lee sits down at the piano and isn't up running around, she sounds *wonderful*. "
4,"I first listened to this CD on my work sound system which does not do it justice.  I was only mildly impressed and was preparing to submit a scathing review with the main focus being ""mediocrity at its best.""  But then I took it home and put it on a real sound system. VOILA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  While I still contend that Gerald is infinitely more viable as a premiere session man than a solo artist, this second outing with GRP is far superior to ""Groovology;""  the former project seemed to be a classic example of an artist suffering from musician's block. ""Kickin' It"" is the exact opposite - with help from the likes of Jeff Lorber and George Duke, it appears creativity was at an all-time high with the end result being a wonderful project that you will enjoy over and over again.  The arrangements are tight with fresh interpretations, a nice ode to Jr. Walker and some oh so nice tunes in collaboration with Lorber.  Quite honestly, I haven't been this impressed with a Gerald Albright project in quite a whie.  It appears he is finally hittinhg his stride and I could not be more pleased.  Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice, Gerald!!!"
4,"Originally released in 1993, Dark Tranquility's Skydancer remains a masterpiece.  Along with At the Gates, In Flames, Carcass, Death and Edge of Sanity, Dark Tranquility created the genre known as melodic death metal. Everything expected of a good melodic death album is here. Aggresive sounds juxtaposed with acoustic parts, an inteligent concept and growled vocals.  Mikeal Stanne is one of the only vocalists who can sound pissed off and peaceful all at the same time.  Many of the ideas such as using female vocals for different effects were way ahead of their time as well. Can't give a perfect rating though because while it's original, the production isn't very well done and they hadn't quite hit the peak of their skills yet"
2,"I was not pleased with the quality of this recording.  The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster.  The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy!  The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible.  I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from ""The Bells of Dublin"" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded).  The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one"
5,"Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other.  It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility.  When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, ""out of my body, out of my skin,"" you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production.  The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of ""One More Hour,"" the fury of ""Words and Guitar,"" the sexiness of ""Dance Song '97.""  This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart"
5,"hes great to listen to, his songs are really good and are easy to sing along to especially manifesto # 1 is my fave"
4,"While Steely Dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion, the latest ""Definitive Collection"" brings some of the band's best known work onto a single disc. Also, for completeness, one track each from their 'reunion' CDs are included here. Steely classics such as ""Do It Again"", ""Reelin' In The Years"", ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"", ""Black Friday"", ""Deacon Blues"", ""Peg"" and ""Hey Nineteen"" are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day. While this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning Dan fan because of its songs and low price, it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this Definitive Collection - the all-time classic ""Josie"". Granted, this CD is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish. However, including ""Josie"" and dropping a track like, say ""Dirty Work"" (writer's opinion) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall. I guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection.  Apart from this, Steely Dan's ""Definitive Collection"" is a great introduction to the band. For a more comprehensive overview, check out the double-disc compilation ""Show Biz Kids"" which includes all of the tracks included here (minus the two 'reunion' tracks) plus many many more."
5,"If you've ever liked the T-Bone Walker style, or drooled over the pure T-Bone licks that both Ronnie and Duke have graced us with over the years, ""Two Bones and a Pick"" is eight minutes of pure jump-blues-guitar-heaven.  I can, and do listen to this for hours on end.  If any two white guys have got that jump-blues-guitar-thang down, it's these two.  T-Bone is grinning like a Cheshire cat"
4,First off; I really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least 60 minutes of play time and don't cut out lengthy guitar solos.  This CD certainly delivers in this regard as Ronnie Earl and the Duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid 70 plus minutes.  This is a close 5 star recommendation but it isn't a classic and it isn't groundbreaking; although I would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point.  It's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another.  Highly recommended.
4,"The first time I heard Cannibal Ox was last winter in my friends snowboard video. He did the intro over the first and in my opinion BEST track on the CD Iron Galaxy. Basically that got me interested in the group and I later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever Company Flow.  I copped their CD, but waited a really long time to listen to it. It's pretty futuristic, kind of abstract like Deltron 3030 (another one of my favs), while the lyrical content is nowhere near Deltron (hell, what is?) it is very good. I mean obviously you should expect to hear a LOT of Co-Flow when you listen to this, so if you're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up. The CD has some very good songs A B-Boys Alpha, Atom, and another one of my favorites, The Battle For Asgard. However I think some songs on here tanked the whole album. For one- a couple of the tracks on the CD are weakly produced, Stress Rap & Painkillers. And a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that, Vein & Real Earth.  Basically this CD is 80% genius, so 4 stars is what it gets-and to be honest I'd like to just give it 3.5 because I feel they coulda done a lot better"
1,"Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole ""I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it"" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music"
1,"THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK. I MEAN WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE LOUSY BANDS IN QUEEN, CARS, ACDC, BEATLES, STONES, WHO, STEVE MILLER, AND BOSTON? GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION. GO GET A BETTER ALBUM FROM NIRVANA INSTED. PS THE CARS SUCK"
2,"paul what were you thinking? you do so good on mixtapes lyricly and on get ya mind correct but on this no effort! ok first im a playa taken from still tippin, internet goiong nutz from still tippin all with corny flows repeatative terms but some songs were good sittin sideways was already rammed into my head like a year before it came out so what does that leave you with? surp sippin bugz bunny? what? chick magnet or how to be a player should have been re released instead of this cd! big ballin was pretty good but still the cd is just not worth listenen to buy the paul wall mixtape its got all the good songs and more the mixtape is way better trust me! he needs some new flows! fo real! oh yeah this tracklist aint right atleast with the cd i got."
1,"Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD"
2,"Kim Waters is one of the nicest persons one could meet, but that still does not prevent me from giving a brutally frank review that will hopefully help him in the future. While I could tell that considerable time was put in this project, that drum machine killed this effort. The music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine, I just can't stand to listen to it. The drum machine cheapens the sound so much that I cannot recommend this CD to real music lovers especially those with decent audio systems. The only composition that sounds like real music is ""Daydreaming"", but this too is somewhat marred by that mechanical drum machine although less than the others. Kim, please use real drums from now on. You are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent, but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine. That machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity. You are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it. It may cost a little more for a real drummer, but you are in a class where real drums are indispensible"
5,"This is an excellent CD.  It is fun to dance to, sing to, and drive to.  It doesn't matter if you like country music or not-you can enjoy Keith Urban's music.  Even better than his CD's are his live shows.  Well worth the ticket price and one of the best concerts you will see. "
5,"Well, I have to confess that I had never heard of Chris until I was taken to a concert back in 2004. Of all the bands that played that night, I have to admit Chris really reached me.  This CD has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock. Chris' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to U2's 'the Edge' especially on 'Forever' which really adds a great dimension to the song.  I had never fully appreciated worship songs until I heard Chris do 'How Great is Our God' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this CD.  Besides those tunes, the CD becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'Indescribable' and other popular songs such as 'Famous One' & 'Raise Up Holy Hands.'  I had been hoping since that concert that he would release a CD from that tour, and my hope has now been answered (imagine that).   2/06 update: eight of us just saw Chris again in Saginaw, MI and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives.  It's certainly difficult for a CD to fully match the experience of being there, but with the right perspective, it can get you pretty close.  Be sure to try and see Chris on his current tour w/Matt Redman & speaker Louie Giglio"
5,"I have to admit, it took me awhile to actually enjoy Relient K. I used to think their music was very generic and their lyrics were cheesy. But this album changed everything for me. Matt Thiessen is such a clever lyricist, using enough word plays to delight the wordsmith in me, but also making me think more deeply about my relationship with God and others.  The band sticks to their standard pop-punk riffs on this album, though I believe they use smoother speed and instrumental transitions on this album. Example: Be My Escape starts with screaming guitars and a fast beat, softens down to keyboards, vocals and light drumming during the verses, back up to rocking during the bridge and chorus, and slows right down for a touching finish. There are several other songs that vary in a like manner.  Lyrically, I really enjoyed Be My Escape (but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair), Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet (I move you, but you just wouldn't budge, I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge), When I Go Down (When I go down, I'll lift my eyes to You, but I won't look too far, 'Cause You'll be there with open arms, to lift me up again...). What a beautiful way to end the album!  Musically, many songs stand out - High of 75 is probably the most original song, starting with acoustic guitar, and including a drum loop in the chorus. Other highlights include Who I am Hates Who I've Been, and Life After Death & Taxes, which combines great vocals with some cool screaming!  Relient K has made a fan out of me, and if you buy this album, it will do the same for you"
1,"I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad. And god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys. Overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep. Stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do.."
2,"If you've listened to Alison Krauss, you've heard the best.  Rhonda's arrangements and voice were adequate, but nothing special, and I doubt I'll listen to the CD again. "
1,"This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive"
2,"In the past few months, I have gotten super into all of Devendra's other works, and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when I first picked this album up.  Oh, what a dissapointment I was in for.  The album does not carry through it's energy as many of Banhart's other albums do so well.  Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do.  That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful.  I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.    So, the moral?  If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet.  I highly recommend ""Cripple Crow"", his split album with Jana Hunter, and, if you are into music that is slightly more raw, ""The Black Babies"", which is my personal favorite"
5,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway"
1,"Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money"
5,"This album further compliments the astonishing work the artist has done along with the spectacular singing of The Love Fellowship Choir! I must say when I hear the work of this ensemble I am all ears because I'm never disappointed in knowing they will always ""Bring it"" !!  God Bless!!"
5,"TERMINAL HEAVEN'S ROCK IS A GREAT SONG! Sick Vibration and OVER AMP are pretty good too. OVER AMP has usual weird english lyrics. ""She lives by fake slide away"".  I highly recomend you get this. It's 12 minutes, 8 seconds a pure good songs. You will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your CD player"
5,"I like every song.  Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD"
2,"all of the songs on this album are very good, however it doesn't live up to standards. sublimes a much better band than this album shows. if your a casual fan, i would not recomoned this to start. instead, i'd recomend ""40 oz. to Freedom"" thats my personal favorite Sublime album. it may not have all the hits on it, but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled. great songs, terrible compilatio"
2,"When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World"
5,"This album was released three years after the New Pornographers awesome debut album. This album is similar, but has a more glossy feel than the previous album. The album is definately more polished. Great synths and percussion throughout the album. Electric Version is an enjoyable and easy listen, chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock's classic humility"
5,"Guns N'Roses are one of my all time favorite bands, so this album is a little disappointing, don't get me wrong, nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving. It just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right, just look at Led Zeppelin's Greatist hits. The only reason the record label released this anyways was because Axl was taking way to long for Chinese Domocracy and they wanted some money, so they put this out, and it has gathered a good deal of money. This Album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know, that Guns N' Roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time. They came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior, and they did just that, they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music. Songs like november rain, welcome to the jungle, and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points, thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan. I would reccomend buying all their albums though, because all of them are genius, except for the spaghetti incident, which was just a cover album anyways.  This album did fail to include classic cuts like Mr.Brownstone, It Ain't easy, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and others and for that I am angry. Also, how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here, it is simply terrible, possibly the worst Guns N' Roses song ever. So, if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums, don't get this, save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come, there have been rumors of a release before the year's end. I have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible, cuts like madagascar, the blues, Rhiad and the Bedouins reaffirmed my belief in Axl, and I think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge. Also check out a band called Rose hill Drive, they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll should enjoy them."
5,A great white noise kind of CD.  Just plain rain.  Well I must admit it sounds a wee bit like frying bacon to me.  Whatever.  My babies both nap really well to it.  I recommend it to my mommy friends.  It's been a must at our house
2,"This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all."
4,"This CD is just okay. The early JB ballads are the thing here. Gives you a good idea of a good chitlin' circuit performance as typically done for Black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response. The standouts here include the extended version of &quot;Lost Someone&quot; which leads into &quot;Please Please Please.&quot; Even without being able to see the infamous cape routine, it's quite entertaining. But overall, Vol. 2 is better since that CD plays up the more uptempo stuff that put JB on the map"
5,"Ok, so KS has a similar voice to Conor Oberst. So what? What's the big deal? Blink-182, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan all sound exactly the same, and they're getting five star reviews! Just lay off of it. And, even though their voices are similar, their music is much different, they sound different. They even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and... well, that's it. But this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band. And, maybe his voice naturally sounds like Conor Oberst's. You can't help that. An Angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds. I pop this CD in from time to time, not my favorite, but it's very good! So, just give this a chance without thinking it as a Bright Eyes rip-off, because that's just what it's not"
5,"I came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate, not knowing what to expect. Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix.  Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt.  And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who.  Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz.  My recommendations are: The Update, Futterman's Rule, Flute Loop, Sure Shot, Heart Attack Man, B-Boys making with the Freak Freak.  Enjoy"
5,"I'm ashamed to say that, even as an adult, I love the music on this CD! The kids listen to it in the car and on their little CD player. They are older (8 and 11), so they already knew the lower times tables, but all the songs are great so we listen to them anyway and now they can remember all the numbers. (They go up to 13.)  It's a long CD - definately longer than other kids music - but it has a story to it that follows along with the songs. It's like listening to a book on tape. After years of Barney and SpongeBob (neither did much for my kids' brains), I'm so glad to have something that *I* can sing along with too"
5,"I had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was, so I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon! Granted, it's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover, but this one fits in my car stereo, makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago! Thanks"
1,"Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB!"
5,"OutKast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity.  This album is crunk, it's exciting, it's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best.  OutKast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way (OutKast is the anti-Black Eyed Peas, LOL).  Stankonia just continues OutKast's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels.  If you've listened to Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik, ATLiens and Aquemini, you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album.  Stankonia is one of the hip hop albums I always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time.  That Andre 3000 is deceptively very, very political, but you gotta pay attention or you'll miss his messages.  Highly recommended LP. Fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary. One of my all-time favorite albums"
1,"This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to ""This Love"" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists"
1,"Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap"
1,"Before you dismiss me as a stupid hater, hear me out. I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.   This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.  However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. ""I Wish"" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled ""O"", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. ""Touch"" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget ""Growing Pains"", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!  However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!   NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career"
2,Jaheimのような才能あるアーティストから期待されたものではありません、彼はプロデューサーを変えたのでしょうか？プロデューサーを変えたのでしょうか？音楽と声の男が私にはうまくマッチしていませんでした。  このアルバムは、彼の前の2枚のアルバムから大きくグレードダウンしたもので、購入することはないでしょう。次回はもっと頑張ってください、Jaheim 本当にがっかりしました。
1,これは映画の音楽ではありません。この購入は大失敗でした。タイトルの音楽クレジットを検索して、音楽配信会社からトラックをダウンロードした方が良いだろう。
1,このCDを録音しなければならなかった技術者に感謝して、星1つ。なんということでしょう！決して作られるべきではありませんでした。ジュリーだって、これをステージで演奏するのはもう限界だ。彼女は歌の途中で半分しゃべり、その声は明らかにこの映画を作った時のものではありません。ジュリーには申し訳ないが、そっとしておくべきだった。  他のキャストも映画と同レベルではありません。ロバート・プレストンの代わりに出演したトニー・ロバーツ...彼の最高の日ではない。レスリー・アン・ウォーレンは映画ではとても斬新でしたが、レイチェル・ヨークは彼女の真似をしようとしているようですが、そうではありません。マイケル・ヌーリ？最低です。舞台用に追加された曲は......もういい。これ以上言及する価値もない。彼らは何を考えていたのか」というファイルに入っている。ジュリーがトニー賞のノミネートを拒否したのは、他のショーが見過ごされたから？ジュリー、それは理由があったんだ、ショーがクソだったからさ！
1,Laylaは史上最も過大評価された曲のひとつだ。クリームは歴史上最も退屈なバンドのひとつだ。自分のために、ダイアー・ストレイツやメタリカのようなロックで楽しいバンドを買ったらどうだろう。  PS.このクラプトンのコンピレーションには良い曲がないので、絶対に買わないでください。
1,私はこの録音が本当にひどいもので、ルース・ヘンシャールが唯一聴く価値のあるものでした。ジョージ役のジョン・シンクレアは忌々しい。まるで『ハロー、ドリー』のマイケル・クロフォードの（下手な）真似をしているように聞こえる。    イローナは低音で、文字通り低音なのです。彼女のために、&quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot;の第2パートは、実に奇妙なキーチェンジをしています。彼女が少しでも才能があれば、彼女が歌いやすいようにキーチェンジするのも理解できるのだが、彼女にはその価値はない。    オーケストレーションも奇妙で、奇妙なそり鐘の音が頻繁に登場する。他の歌手は、まあまあ（コダーイ-きれいな声だが、あまり表現力がない）から悪い（マラチェク氏は、「Days Gone By」のEVER SINGLE NOTEを引きずっている。）    もちろん、バーバラ・クック（オリジナル）が、ダイアン・フラタントーニを圧倒していることを除けば、ブロードウェイのリバイバルは、私の耳には、まだ最高の声を持っています（しかし、ラウンドアバウトのオリジナルのアマリア、迷惑なジュディ・クーンよりはずっと進歩していました）。     このロンドン版は、「SHE LOVES ME」の熱烈なファンか、マゾヒストにしか勧められません。私はこれをもう一度聴くくらいなら、「You've Got Mail」のひどい視聴をもう一回我慢する方がましです。
1,セックス・ピストルのことを考えると、モンキーズはボーイズ・バンドとしてもっとうまくやっていたと思う。正直に言うと、セックス・ピストルとは、マーケティングのための策略だったのです。彼らは別の世代のNSyncのようなものだ。
2,ニコラ・ディ・バリの15曲の大ヒット曲をスペイン語で収録したこのコレクションには、彼の最も重要で人気のある曲の1つ、quot;Lisa de los ojos azules&quot;が欠けています。この曲がなければ、このCDは買わなかっただろう。
1,"なぜこのアルバムを楽しむ人がいるのか、私には理解できない。歌詞はダダイストの詩壇から飛び出してきたようなものだし、（ほとんどの）ギターワークにはまったく個性がない。  良いロック・アルバムの基準とは何だろう？どんな基準であれ、それを演奏することが喜びでなければならない。6teen Stone』は、意図的なものと思わざるを得ないほど、その基準を大きく逸脱している。しかし、ブッシュがニルヴァーナを模倣しようとしたことに対しては、怒りというより軽蔑の念を抱かせる。ニルヴァーナが明瞭なギターリフとミニマルで喚起的な歌詞を持つのに対し、ブッシュは鈍い鼓動のギタードローンで、リスナーには倦怠感からくる怒りのようなものしか映し出さない。  6teen Stone』について、これ以上言うことはない。Swim』のような曲の歌詞を聴くことの恥ずかしさについては語れるだろうが：薄くなった氷／14台のヘアードライヤー／あなたへ泳ぐ／地上の炎の欲望」。あるいは、最後の曲である「X-Girlfriend」の芸術的な自殺は、小さなギターのウェーリングと6語程度のノンストップ・コーラスで構成された曲である。  それくらいしか言えない。もう十分な警告をしたつもりなので、あなた自身の判断で選んでください。このアルバムには、""Machinehead ""と ""Glycerine ""に分かれて、約5分の良い音楽が収録されているのだ。1曲目はエネルギッシュで、コントロールについてよく構成された曲（11年ほど前にTotal Request Liveでこの曲のPVを見たことがあるかもしれない）、2曲目はオーバーダブされたギター、震えるチェロ、驚くほどまとまりのあるロスデイルによるセレナーデである。この曲は、崩れかけた建物を支える根太と同じように、このアルバムを支えている。"
1,Amazonで楽曲が聴けないのは理由があります-聴けたら買わないでしょう。私は多くのレビューを読み、メタリカが少しでも似ていると言及されていることから、試してみる価値があると考えました。このバンドはメタリカとは似ても似つかない。ディスクは捨ててしまった。
2,私はシェリル・クロウをいつも中道的なロックアーティストとして見てきました。   妻と私は彼女のディスクを何枚か手に入れ、さらに「ベスト盤」のCDも手に入れたので、彼女の最新作をとても楽しみにしていたのだが、この作品は...zzzzzzz、シェリルのコーヒーに何を入れているのだろうと思わせるものだった。   このアルバムには「ハートとソウル」が詰まっていると言っているレビュアーもいますね？  そうかもしれませんが、非常に洗練されたダルスヴィルの作品でもあるのです。   アルバムカバーのグラフィックについては、あるレビュアーが書いていたようなロジャー・ディーンのYesのカバーや60年代風のサイケデリアではなく、多くのアーティストやバンドが使っている非常に「モダン」なグラフィックアートを見ることができます。ケリー・クラークソン、ヴァインズ、ドンナなどなど、数え上げればきりがない。  ハイライトグッドイズグッド（そろそろ新しい「ベスト盤」コレクションが必要な時期なのでは？）
1,KID RAPに改名してくれ...。  真のロックCDを作り始めたら、その時だけ偽名にロックを戻すべきだ...。  両方の立場を演じるのはやめてくれ...。  ラップやヒップホップのシーンは、ファン層の半分以上が小さな女の子や男の子、そして音楽が何であるかの手がかりを持っていない人たちなので、ずっと簡単だと私は理解しています。  自分のために、あなたの音楽と呼ばれるものからラップやヒップホップを取り除いてみてください。ラップ/ヒップホップシーンは、本当の音楽ファンが嫌いで、消えて欲しいと願う悪い臭いのようなものだと、ある日あなたは気づくだろう。          
1,amazonはいつになったら星ゼロの評価ができるようになるのでしょうか？
1,5歳以下のお子さんをお持ちの方は、お子さんのラジカセに入れたり、テーププレーヤーにカセットで入れたりするのに良いアルバムだと思います。  もし、この曲が見つかれば、本物の曲を見つけて焼いたほうがいい。  このアルバムは、子供に音楽を聴かせたいが、その余裕がない貧しい人々のために厳重に保存されるべきです。  このアルバムがルワンダやスーダンなどの第三国で売られたら、1位になるでしょうね。  親御さん、このアルバムを買ったら、お子さんが6歳になったら、このCDと他のKi8dz BopのCDを梱包して、アフリカに送ってあげてください。  これは貧しい人々のためのポップミュージックだ。
2,"まず最初に、これは私が聴いたCorrsの最初のリリースです。私は、彼らが他に何をしたのか知らないまま、私の意見を述べます。このCDを10回ほど聴いた。パンクやガレージ・ロックといった普段の食事から離れたいときに、ふと聴くことがある。  いい音です。ちょっと良すぎるくらい。過剰なプロデュース、自発的なサウンドでないことは同意する。スタジオワークはよくできているが、やりすぎだ。彼らが本当にどんな音なのか、他のものを聴いてみたい。  曲の内容が気になるところです。これはポップミュージックであり、それ以外のことは期待していない）、すべてが商業的な小曲か映画のサウンドトラックの一部のように聞こえる。ふむふむ。  トラック1 - カーブス(TM)のトレッドミルで微笑み、フォード・エクスペディション(TM)に飛び乗り、両手にサニーD(TM)を持って子供たちのサッカーゲームを応援する、それほど太ってはいないサッカーママの姿が見える。  トラック2 - 20代半ばの女性がVWカブリオ(TM)(R)でカーブの多い山道をトップダウンで走り、イケメンの恋人を思いながらヘリコプターをパンパン飛ばす...。画面右下に ""LMN""(R)のウォーターマークが入る。  トラック3 - 悲しい動物たち。檻の中の子犬の映像。  トラック4 「実は、この曲、好きなんです。まったり、のんびり。  トラック5 - うっ。  トラック6 - この曲は最も賢い曲だ！バンドメンバー（女の子3人、男1人）が、真っ黒な部屋の吊りランプの下にあるテーブルの片側に座っていて、スーツを着た紳士3人がお金の入ったブリーフケースを開け、彼らの方に押し付けてこう言うんだ。子供たちは、私たちが電波に乗せているバンド以外に、他のバンドがあることを知りつつあるんだ。彼らを呼び戻す必要があるのです。もしシングルが欲しいなら、そしてこの大金がそうだと言うなら、この死にゆくメディアを救うためにできることをするんだ。""ラジオ ""という言葉を入れてくれれば、倍額を出すよ......""この曲は、まるで国際ラジオ・マーケティング協議会のPSAのように聞こえる。  トラック7 - ペプシのCMのような音。  トラック8 - うっ。待って、これってトラック5じゃなかったっけ？  トラック9 - サッピーだが、大丈夫だ。歌詞に力が入っているように聞こえる。親指を立てる。  トラック10 - オリジナリティはないが、まあまあ。  Track 11 - 面白いサウンド。いいビートだ。もし間違っていたら訂正してほしいのですが、これは半異教徒への言及なのでしょうか？もしそうだとしたら、それは大胆な行動で、私は彼らに拍手を送りたい。私が異教徒だからというわけではありませんが、マリリン・マンソンに関係なく、宗教的にポジティブで、キリスト教以外のものに言及するのは、勇気がいることだと思います。特にラジオ好きのガールズ・バンドにとってはね。  トラック12：ゆったりとした曲。ジャジーでラウンジのような雰囲気がある。  トラック13 - 元エース・オブ・ベースのメンバーによるプロデュース？バブリーでアップビート、悪くない。  トラック14 - アヴリル・ラヴィーンの作曲とプロデュース...。  トラック15 「WOW！比較的ケルト的なバンドの、比較的ケルト的なサウンドの曲です！！そして、インストゥルメンタルも、大きなサムシングアップ！実は、そこがポイントかも。  とにかく。長文になったが、まあいい。このアルバムでCorrsを完全に嫌いになったわけではないが、今はあまり期待してない。  燃え尽きてしまえ、君たち"
2,私はバッファローに住んでいて、プログレの大ファンなので、図書館でこのCDを見たとき、無料で聴かなければならないと思いました。   しかし、間違いなく、このCDは多くの面で期待を裏切るものでした。    エイジアには、大好きなギタリスト（スティーブ・ハウ）、一流のドラマー（カール・パーマー）、実績のあるベーシスト／ヴォーカリスト（ジョン・ウェットン）がいて、素晴らしいバンドであってほしいといつも思っていました。  しかし、彼らの音楽には、いつも「ポップ」、「シンプル」、「繰り返し」が多すぎて、私を完全に惹きつけることはできませんでした。  プログレッシブ・ロックは「異質」、「複雑」、「変化」をテーマにしているんだろう？  Asiaはプログレッシブ・ポップ・バンド（トッド・ラングレンのユートピアの後期のアルバムに似ている）で、良い音楽を作るが、あまり何かを開拓することはなかった。    このCDもそうだ。  このCDには、スタジオ・ヴァージョンの曲よりも新しい、あるいは優れているものはほとんどない。  パルマーの長いドラムソロはしばらくすると飽きてしまう。  スティーブのアコースティック・ソロは他のYesのレコーディングで聴くことができるし、そちらの方がずっと良い出来だ。  (正直なところ、私は古いKenner Close'n'Playからより良い忠実度を聞いたことを覚えている！）。  スティーブが再びバッファローで演奏することに喜びを感じているのを聞くのはとてもクールだった！  しかし、Geoff Downsのいわゆる「キーボード・ソロ」は、控えめに言っても圧倒的で、彼が他の偉大なプログレの名人たちのグループの中で弱いリンクのようなものだという私の疑いを強めたものだった。    あるバンドを愛しすぎると、そのバンドのほとんどすべてのCDの欠点を盲目的に見過ごすことができるのだろうし、そういう人にとってはそれでよいのだろう。  しかし、このCDの客観的な現実は、他の多くの人の既存のレビューに忍び寄る：すなわち、プロダクション・クオリティが劣る（時にはイライラするほど）、ボーカルとハーモニーがしばしば調子を崩す（79分の音楽の間にこれほど苦しまなければならないことはない！）、これは明らかに1枚のアルバムだが何らかの理由で2枚組になった、パッケージとライナーノートが少ない、演奏はただスタジオ版にあまり追加されていない。  これはAsiaのコンプリート・ファンだけのためのものです。    Asiaは最初のスタジオ・アルバムで5つ星のプログレッシブ・ポップCDを作りました。  私はそれが大好きです。  しかし、彼らはそれを改良することもなく、新しい領域へ伸びることもなかった。  おそらくこの1982年のライブ録音は、この潜在的なスーパーグループを「良い」から「素晴らしい」にすることを妨げた弱点のいくつかを暴露しているのだろう。    地元の図書館を応援しましょう。  (そして、この場合、現金を節約するのだ！）。
1,彼らの新作はもっとひどい。しかし、これはやはり性差別的で退屈で迷惑な音楽の最たるものです。もっといいアーティストがいるのに、なぜこの才能のない2人のラッパーに耳を傾けるのか
2,これが、不真面目な態度でウィットに富んだ韻を踏んでいたD-12と同じなのだろうか。まあ、これで本当に彼らが脇役に過ぎないことが証明されたかな。エミネムはプロダクションが違うから、グループもプロダクションが違うだろう。エミネムがよりシリアスになったから、グループもよりシリアスになる。   それに加えて、シェイディ自身（あるいはかつての彼の残滓）は、基本的にノーショーだ。エミネムが参加している曲はたいてい最強で、この曲もそうだ。しかし、だからといって彼が素晴らしいというわけではない。つまり、このCD自体が、エミネムの次のCD（「アンコール」、これはこれより良かったが、全体としてはそれほど良くはない）のための誤認、矛盾、サイドショーである。   D-12はエミネム・ショーのコマーシャルであり、みんなその間に入るのを待っているのだ。それがここでのケースだ。
1,"""I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper) ""を聴いて。このCDを買って丸ごと聴きたいと思う人の気持ちがわからない。このCDがなぜ最悪なのか、長いパラグラフを何個も打つつもりはない。このCDは無駄であり、T-Painは文盲である。そこだ！一文で言ってしまった。ホルラアアア"
1,まずFLOETICが素晴らしいアルバムで、SUPERSTARをラジオで聴いた後、FLO'OLOGYもクラシックになると思っていたんだ。しかし、それは間違いでした。このアルバムはオリジナリティに欠け、正確には劣っている。このCDを初めてシステムに入れた時、スキップフォワードボタンと友達になっている自分に気がついた。レコードの長さは卑劣だ。このCDは持つ価値がない...私にとって目立つトラックはSUPERSTARだけで、COMMONはすごいと思う。
1,このCDのどこを評価しているのか、途方に暮れています。  私たちは一回聴くのがやっとでした。  このCDは、アーティスト（この言葉は非常に緩やかですが）が音楽以外の何かですでに有名でなかったら、決して制作されなかったであろうCDの典型例です。  このCDの才能とオリジナリティの欠如はひどいものです。  星1つなのは、それが最低の評価だからです。  お金を返してほしい。
2,これは癒し系ではありません。音色が高すぎて、私が期待していたカーメルの岩場の海岸線に打ち寄せる波の重低音のようなものはありません。ダン・ギブソンのオーシャン・サーフCDを購入したところ、波が打ち寄せる音ではないものの、よりリラックスできることがわかりました。私の目標であった眠りにつくことができました。これでOcean Wavesを返せればいいのですが。
1,ありがたいことに、私はこれを図書館で借りて、お金をかけずに済みました。  でも、これから買おうと思っている人のために、レビューをつける必要を感じました。  子供と一緒に一度だけCDを聴き通しましたが、それだけでした。  もう二度と聴くことはないでしょう。  他の方もおっしゃっていますが、Radio DisneyのCDを買ってください（KidzBopの後期バージョンがもっと良い評価を得ていれば、そちらも）。  KidzBobの歌手（子供も大人も！）は音程が狂っており、聴くのが苦痛です。   
1,初期のPriestが好きなら、Genocideを買いましょう。Rocka RollaとSad Wings of Destinyが全曲入っています（入っていないのはオリジナルのアルバムアートワークだけです）。リッパーのような重要なトラックを省くのはやめてくれ、頼むから!リッパーを省くなんてありえない。そして、Island of Dominationはどうなんだ？これを買った、プリーストを知らない人がかわいそうだ。彼らは騙された上に、それに気づいていない。プリーストのアルバムの中で一番好きなアルバムなのに、こんな風に切り刻まれるのは嫌だ...。そして曲順はどうなんだ？なぜ彼らはそれを台無しにしたのだろう？もし、オリジナルのアートワークが好きなら、Rocka RollaとSad wings of Destinyを別々に買うと良いだろう。
1,これは、黒人女性や一般的な女性がなぜ軽んじられるのかを示す完璧な例です。リルキムは、何世代もの女性たちに、自分ができる限りの意地悪をし、自分を軽んじることを教えているのです。その上、彼女はまだ、超ファンタジーなギャングスタ・ラッパーであるビギーの尻尾にぶら下がっているのです。クイーン・ラティファは、自分の名前を広めるため、あるいは良い音楽を作るために、このような話し方をする必要はなかったのです。こんなの馬鹿げてる！キムはラップゲームよりポルノ映画に出たほうがいい。お願いだから私たちに免じて、ラップをやめて
2,私はデスティニーズ・チャイルドが大好きなのですが、このCDは...大失敗でした。CD全体の中で一番良かった曲は、Lose My Breath、Cater 2 U、Girlだったかな...大きな失望だ...CDを買った時、私はただこのCDを感じなかった。
2,一部のレビューでは、不慣れな人の最初の購入には向かないという意見もあるようです。  私はその主張を確認するために書いています。  私は、彼らのその後のリリースについての絶賛レビューを十分に読み、ここから本当に良くなることを知りましたが、このアルバムは私にとってなんと失望したことでしょう。  隣のガレージから聞こえてくるような音です。  子供たちへのアドバイスとしては、練習を続けること、そして音量を下げてほしいということです。  ジャックのブルースへの造詣は立派だが、それを実感できるのは「I Fought Piranhas」という曲だけである。  この曲はアルバムの最後の曲である。  それ以外の曲は忘れられるし、時にはイライラすることさえある。
1,"私がCDを一音も聴かずに購入するアーティストの音楽は、2人しかいない。その2人とは、バーブラ・ストライサンドとリンダ・エダーです。""Songs of Judy Garland ""は、大いに期待はずれだった。CDのジャケットに驚きました。リンダ・エダーがどんな ""ルック ""を目指していたのかは知らないが、的外れだった。10歳も若く見えるどころか、見分けがつかないほど変貌している。不気味で、ちょっと小心者の子供のようでもある。  エダーさんはもともととても魅力的な女性で、このような「変身」は絶対に必要なかった。そして音楽...私は何度も好きになろうとした。しかし、聴けば聴くほど、私は母親の音楽を歌う「ライザ・ミネリ」を聴いていることに気づいたのです。リンダ・エダーは聴けませんでした。お願いです、エダーさん、作品に立ち返ってください。ごめんなさい...これじゃダメなんです。"
1,このCDがジャズのすべてだと考えているここの大多数の人たちとは、意見が合わない。私はこのCDが耳障りで、ほとんど聴くに耐えないものだと感じています。私はここ数ヶ月で、小さいながらも質の高いジャズ・ライブラリーを構築しました。マイルス・デイビス、デイヴ・ブルーベック、ケニー・バレル、グラント・グリーン、キャノンボール・アダレイ、スタン・ゲッツ、チェット・ベイカー、ウェス・モンゴメリー、ビル・エヴァンス、セロニアス・モンクなどなど、挙げればきりがない。この男は、私が最も嫌いな男である。私が持っているマイルス・デイビスのCDやモンクとの演奏は大体楽しめるし、彼が巨人であることは知っている。でも、この曲は？ディスク2のライブ録音はとても耳障りで、最後まで聴くことができなかった。私には、ガチョウの群れが屠殺されているように聴こえました。いつでも他のメンバーを呼んでくれ
2,車のCDプレーヤーで再生できなかったので、自宅のDVDプレーヤーで聴くしかない。
1,そう、このCDは最悪なんだ。あのデペッシュ・モードの男は本当にランダムだ。パンク・オ・ラマのレビューを見ている人がデペッシュ・モードに興味があるとどうして思うんだ？REMも最悪だ。マイケル・スタイプは今までで一番自己陶酔したハゲのおっさんだ。
2,このアルバムは、私が持っていない唯一のライブアルバムの1つです。しかし、他のCDでサンプルと数曲の追加曲を聴いたことがある。このアルバムについて誰かから聞いた最初の言葉は、基本的にスティーヴィーがこれ以上ないほどハイテンションだったということです。彼のパフォーマンスは、グループの他のメンバー（特にリース・ワイナンズ）にとって恥ずかしくなるようなものだった。ほとんどの人は知らないだろうが、このアルバムの古いレコード盤には、（私は聴いたことがないが、ある人が教えてくれた）もともと14曲目が入っていた。それはスティーヴィーのセットの最後近くに来ることが多い曲でした。その曲は「ライフ・ウィズアウト・ユー」でした。最後の曲だから、スティーヴィーは今まで以上にウンザリしていたと思うし、ものすごくハイになっていたと思う。ハイになるのも一つの手ですが、ハイになってセットで最後の曲を演奏するのは最悪です。古いレコード盤では、スティーヴィーが最後の曲を演奏していたのですが、彼はひどくスローで、リース・ワイナンズは恥ずかしくて落胆してステージから立ち去ったそうです。この曲は、その不愉快さのためにアルバムから外されました
2,ビル・チャーラップは間違いなく、現在最も才能があり、歌詞に恵まれたジャズ・ピアニストの一人である。  彼は巧みなタッチと、年齢や人生経験をはるかに超えた老練さを持っている。  とはいえ、彼の最新作『Stardust』に2つ以上の星をつけるのは非常に難しい。  ごく少数の例外を除いて、このCDはかなり独りよがりで、チャールプの解釈はかなり不機嫌だと感じた。Written in the Starsのような耳触りの良さはありませんでした。  シャルラップ信奉者にはお勧めできるが、それ以外の人にはお勧めできない。  彼はもっといいアルバムを作っている
1,これは映画と同じくらい悪い。事実、映画と同じようにサントラも同じ古いフォーミュラだ。Will&amp;His Movies&amp;Music Never change the same Old Beat.The Rest Of The Soundtrack is just as bad.UNORIGINAL&amp;BORING.What A Waste of KOOL MOE DEE
2,ヴィヴァルディのオペラの修復は、特に大きな空白を埋め、傑作の大きな欠落部分を再構築するのであれば、賞賛に値する取り組みである。モテズマ』はその例で、音楽的、芸術的に十分な許可を得て、この作品に生命を吹き込んだのです。色や形が薄れただけでなく、大きな部分が剥がれ落ちて失われたキャンバスを修復するように、「モテズマ」を再構築することは、修復家にとって、考え、夢想し、ヴィヴァルディのようにインスピレーションを得るための挑戦となる。モテズマ』を聴くと、ピカソとミケランジェロの合体画を見るように、復元された素材からヴィヴァルディの原曲をはっきりと感じ取ることができます。このような絵画が目に負担をかけるのと同様に、このオペラの一部は、耳に失望を与える。いくつかのアリアと2つのシンフォニアを除いて、音楽は1800年代のタッチと味わいを持っているが、バロックのセッテチェントには及ばない。また、修復的なスタイルの並置は、気が散ってしまい、うまくいかない。そのため、オーケストレーションには、ヴィヴァルディのような魅力や質感が感じられないことがある。   しかし、「モテズマ」の音楽的な美しさは、「ディラ・エ・フロール・アルマート」「ラ・フィリア・ロ・スポーゾ」「グロトラッジ・デラ・ソルテ」「ドーヴェ・ラ・フィリア」「スインプグニ・ラ・スパーダ」といった素晴らしいアリアと、ヴィト・プリアンテ、インガ・クルナ、マリヤナ・ミヤノヴィッチの演奏から見つけることができます。Vito PrianteとGI'otraggi della Sorte、D'ove la Figliaの解釈にはブラボーです。彼はダ・カーポで素晴らしい装飾を施し、すべての正しい音で音量を上げています。Terribile lo Sento」「Orribile lo Scempio」と同じように、「GI'otraggi」も同じ音楽性を持っています。なぜか、このバージョンのスコアは特にドラマチックで、微妙にメロディックになっている。
2,私のような筋金入りのコレクター（何年も前にレコードで持っていた）でない限り、このアルバムには手を出すな。もし、あなたとあなたの奥さん、ガールフレンド、ボーイフレンドが自分でできるノイズを聴きたいのなら、このアルバムは忘れて、あなた自身でノイズを作ってください。このアルバムのベストトラックはボーナストラックだ。このアルバムがビートルズの音楽と何の関係もないことを物語っている。このアルバムは、ビートルズの音楽とは何の関係もないことを物語っている。）    msnで「Judemac Forever」を検索する

1,ジェフ・バックリーとの比較は全く理解できない！あれは、このバンドがアルバム全体で持っているよりも、小指に多くの才能を持っていたシンガーだったんだ。どの曲も似すぎているし、この人の声はしばらくすると聞いていて飽きるし、ロンドン・スウェードを覚えているなら、彼らと非常に似たサウンドを持っている（ただし、ロンドン・スウェードの方がずっと良かったとは言うけれど）。J.バックリー（あるいはティム・B.）のパイプに近づける人はここ数年いないし、この作品もそれに匹敵するようなものではない。
1,私は90年代には多くのバンドが良かったと感じています。このバンドもその一つです。アメリカーナやコンスピラシーでは少しポップでセルアウト的でしたが、彼らはまだ十分にバッドアスで、素晴らしい曲を作っていました。彼らは「ダ・フイ」のシングルで「The Noose」と多分「Cant get my head around you」を出すべきだったと思う。これは本当にひどい。普通のコンスピラシーは悪い宗教アルバムに見えてしまうのですから！どうしても聴きたいなら、ダウンロードするか借りるかしてください。お願いだから、みんな辞めるか、いい音楽を作ってください。
2,ジョーン・バエズと同世代（年齢的に）である私は、彼女の初期の音楽とその素晴らしい声のパワーを愛していました。  彼女の政治的な考え方に共感することもあるが、残念ながら、そろそろ彼女はその地位に甘んじている。  このCDでの彼女の歌声は、かつての彼女の能力とはかなりかけ離れており、実際、『バワリー・ソングス』での彼女の歌唱力と、以前の彼女の質とは比較にならないと言わざるを得ない。  某プロスポーツ選手のように、いつ辞めるかわからないようだ...。
2,このたびsacdプレーヤーを購入し、BostonとBilly Joelのthe Strangerを同時に手に入れました。  ストレンジャーを聴いた後、私は口をあんぐり開けてしまいました。  センタースピーカーから聞こえるビリーの声と、あらゆる方向から聞こえてくる他の楽器やメロディー。  そしてボストンを入れてみると、すでに持っているCD版との違いがわからない。  私はこのアルバムがベストアルバムの1つだと思いますが、もしあなたがすでにCDで持っているなら、わざわざアップグレードする必要はありません。
2,興味深い歴史が、現代音楽によってうまく語られないのは不思議なことです。しかし、このCDでは、音楽はストーリーのためにあるのではないと言っているのです。このCDでは、音楽はストーリーのためにあるのではないと言っている。
1,私はこれを、最悪の抽象芸術の音楽版と呼ぶことにします。  意味不明な作品を「評価」する人たちがいるのは、そうしないとバカだと思われるのを恐れてのことだ......ちょうど、皇帝の臣下たちが、彼の服を賞賛して、彼らの目の前で裸でパレードするのを「おお」と「あ」と言ったように
2,このタイトル曲は、「イン・ザ・ゾーン」アルバムに収録されている他の多くの曲と比べると、ダサくて、心が疲れるような駄作です：Breathe on Me」、「Touch of My Hand」、「Shadow」が常にラジオで流れたり、MTVで流れたりするのを想像してください。なぜなら、ブリトニーの貴重な時間が、この退屈な曲をシングルに組み込むために浪費され、さらにはビデオを作ろうとしたため、ブリトニーの怪我につながったことは周知の通りだ。何の意味もない。  幸いこのシングルには、すでに伝説となっている「Toxic」と、「Everytime」の素晴らしいボーカル・ミックス・バージョンが収録されているため、もう一つ星がついた。  
2,デイルは1つの曲を2度同じように演奏することができないと思う。選曲も制作の仕方も好きではなかった。
1,私の8歳の娘は、クリスマスにこのCDを受け取ってとてもがっかりしていました。  このCDはチーター・ガールズ2として宣伝されていますが、このボーカルは映画に出てくるオリジナルのチーター・ガールズが歌っているのではありません。  歌は同じに聞こえない。  ディズニーがこのことをCDで教えてくれないのはとても残念です。
2,ただ、よく読んでください...映画で聴くオーケストラではありませんし、特に声道を聴くとがっかりするかもしれません - 偉大な才能を持つエンヤやアニー・レノックスがいなくなり、無名の声に取って代わられました。  これは悪い音楽ではないが、映画の音楽を安価な2枚組のCDに収めた自分が天才だとは思わないでほしい。
1,COUNTRYを名乗る人がやってはいけないことです。彼女たちはすでにポップなのに、それをさらにポップにするためにリミックスしたのは大きな間違いだった！そしてまた、彼らはより多くのCDを売るために何かをしなければならないのです！笑）！
2,は発送されませんでした。クリスマス前に注文したのですが在庫があると言われました。どこにあるのでしょうか？
2,"1997年頃のイギリス。  トニー・ブレアが首相に選出され、ディ王女が亡くなりました。  そして、スパイス・ガールズが無防備な大衆に解き放たれる。  この作品は、気まぐれな大衆が次善の策に目を向ける前に、この現象に乗じて利益を得ようとする試みである。  公平を期すために、この映画が退屈なものになったのは、彼女たちのせいではありません。  むしろ、彼女たちは魅力的で、この映画の唯一の救いであることが証明されている。  悪いのは、『ハード・デイズ・ナイト』がビートルズにしたように、スパイス・ガールズにしようとする脚本だ。  ファブ・フォーの映画がウィットに富み、ビートルマニアを冷静に解説していたのに対し、この映画は笑えないし、スパイスブームについて何を言おうとしているのか基本的に支離滅裂である。  私は「A Hard Days' Night」よりもモンキーズの「Head」の方を思い出してしまった。  有名人（ロジャー・ムーア、エルトン・ジョンなど）のカメオ出演が多いが、何の意味もない。  まあ、いいや。  ジャスティンからケリーへ ""に続く"
1,19曲のプログレ・トロピカル・インストゥルメンタルは、原始的な音、詠唱、呻き声だけで構成されており、フィル・コリンズが作曲したピグミー・ポルノ音楽と新しい時代の部族的乱交のようなものです。これは、ドラマも陰謀も関連性もないテレビ番組（Survivor Yell、Mud Bath、Chase Race、Tally the Vote、I Can See It、Buzzed）のドラマ、陰謀、関連性を伝えるためのものです。テレビで最も重要でない瞬間の一つを、最後の切り札として必死に掘り起こす。
1,このディスクはBADだ!2インチのところで、「岩の水」の音に、バスタブの水をゆっくり抜くような音が加わります。この音は、多かれ少なかれ、1時間を通して存在する。私が聴いたこのタイプの他のディスクは、このようなことはありません。
2,新しいことは何もない。  私はこのCDの馬鹿げたレビューを読むのが好きで、人々がいかにパットンを愛しているかを画面いっぱいに書き連ねている。  このCDは退屈だ。  パットンの過剰な露出に苦しんでいる。  多分、彼は実際に時間を費やして、何十枚もの単に十分なものよりも、素晴らしいアルバム（Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizonsのように）を作るべきでしょう。
2,このCDの最初の編成を再生したとき、1曲目が本当にジャンプしていたので、もしかしたら本当にステキなCDを購入したのかもしれないと思い始めました。しかし、それ以降、このCDは私にとって期待はずれです。かなり良い曲が3曲ほどあり、あとは全く記憶に残らない。このディスクの3つの良いカットと彼女の最初のCDからのいくつかのカットで、ジョイス・クーリングは1つの良いCDを作ることができただろう。しかし、私の意見では、このCDのリリースを正当化するほど良い曲はないのである。ジョイスは確かにポテンシャルを持っているが、創造性を磨く必要がある。彼女はここでは、まだスタイルが成熟していないアーティストのように聞こえる。
1,もしこれがブルース・ソングだとしたら、私はロバート・ジョンソンの隠し子ということになる。「デス・レター」はいい曲で、もしかしたら素晴らしい曲かもしれないが、オリジナルや以前聴いたどのカバー曲とも比較できない。他は時間の無駄だ。カバーアートは素晴らしいが、このCDを買う理由にはならないだろう。ちなみにこれが私の最初の2つのレビューだが、両方のCDに対するこれらの5星レビューを見て、ようやくやる気が出てきた。マディ・ウォーターかライトニング・ホプキンスのCDを買って、10ドルお得にしよう
2,このCDの中で気に入った曲は2、3曲しかない。Ice CubeとAaliyahは楽しめたが、それ以外の曲は冷めたままだった。この2曲だけ見つけてお金を払ってダウンロードすれば、もっと良かったとは思う！まずは友達から借りて、実際に気に入るかどうかを見てから購入することをお勧めします。
2,スレイヤーは良くなってきている。
1,今まで聴いた中で最悪のクリスマス・アルバム。  買ったばかりで、一度再生しただけで、もう二度と再生することはない。
1,ウルトララウンジシリーズの他のレビューに、このCDはほとんどインストゥルメンタル音楽で、ボーカルをフィーチャーした曲はほとんどない、と書かれていないのが信じられない。  私はラウンジ・ミュージックのCDにはボーカルとインストゥルメンタルの両方が混在していることを期待しているが、私が購入した4枚のUltra Lounge CDのうち、4枚ともボーカルが入っているのは3曲だけである。  インストゥルメンタルの曲は、ラウンジ・ミュージックというジャンルには合っているが、何曲か聴くと、互いに混ざり合い、平凡な曲になってしまう傾向がある。  ウルトララウンジのCDのタイトル（バチェラーパッドやボサノバなど）はほとんど意味がなく、インストゥルメンタル曲ばかりで他のCDと区別がつかない。  私がこれまで聴いた中で最高のラウンジCDは、意外なところから入手したものです。  ポッタリーバーンで購入したもので、ボーカルとインストゥルメンタルの曲が見事にミックスされています。  ラウンジ音楽CDを購入する際には、このことを念頭に置いておくと、私がUltra Loungeシリーズで経験したような失望を味わうことはないでしょう。
1,バディ・ホリーには、20世紀マスターズ・シリーズで出されたものよりも優れたコレクションがいくつもある。  このシリーズのCDはどれも内容がスカスカで余計なものが入っている。  この1枚も例外ではない。   他のところを探す
1,このCDは素晴らしい録音になる素質があった。問題は、ポッパーにどこで演奏しているかを伝えることだった！ブッチ、もう一枚録音してくれ、でもポッパーは家に置いておいてくれ。
1,私はAC/DCのほとんどの音楽が好きだが、最新アルバム『Stiff Upper Lip』には耐えられない。  Stiff Upper LipはAC/DCのアルバムの中で唯一、最後まで再生しても良い曲が1曲も聴けないアルバムです。  Stiff Upper Lip』は『Back in Black』や『Highway to Hell』のような良い曲には遠く及ばない。  このアルバムに収録されているすべての曲は、私を悩ませるだけだ。  このアルバムから1曲聴くだけでも私の忍耐力が試されるのに、この忌まわしい音楽12曲すべてを我慢するのは、私を狂わせるのに十分だ！  全体的なサウンドは、「Highway to Hell」や「Back in Black」のような初期のアルバムに非常によく似ている。  しかし...それらのCDはバラエティに富んでいて、セミ・オリジナルで、実際かなり良かった。  このCDは全く価値がない。  私は今まで何枚かのつまらないCDを聴いてきたが、これほど聴くのが苦痛なCDはなかった。  ボーカリストの声は以前のアルバムより10倍くらい悪いし、音楽はもっさりしていて、反復的で、退屈で、ほとんどの曲が同じに聴こえる。Stiff Upper Lipは、ロックンロールバンドというより、扇風機の単調なドローンのように聞こえるほど、当たり障りのない、退屈なサウンドである。  音楽はとても反復的で似たような音なので、12曲の別々のトラックというより、60分間同じ迷惑な曲を聴いているようだ。  このCDは信じられないほどひどいものです。  このバンドの遺産を汚すものであり、バンドメンバーはこのCDに恥をかくべきだろう。  まあ、彼らはレコード契約を果たす必要があったからこのアルバムを作っただけだろうから、このアルバムがどんなにひどいものであっても気にしないんだろうけど。  私が購入希望者に言えることは、このゴミのような作品にはできるだけ近づかないことです。  これは完全にcr apの破片であり、聴くのに適していない。  Let there Be Rock、High Voltage、Powerage、Highway to Hell、Back in BlackのようなAC/DCの良いCDを買ってください。  Stiff Upper Lipは、紫色のあざが残るほど激しく歌う。  これよりニッケルバックの新しいCDを聴いた方がマシだと思うほどひどい！
1,映画「ICE AGE」の歌詞付き楽曲を探す代わりにこのCDに興味を持たれた方に悪いお知らせです。このCDには収録されていません！  映画のサウンドトラックが発売されるとき、その映画のベストソングやフィーチャーソングが収録されていないのは本当に嫌なものです。  とにかく、マニー、シド、ディエゴ、そして赤ん坊が一緒になってハーフピークに向かって歩いているときに、多くの人が求めている曲は、ラステッドルートの &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; という曲です。彼らの最新アルバム「&quot;When I Woke&quot;」に収録されている曲です。アマゾンの検索エンジンでRusted Rootと入れれば見つかるはずです。  この曲をお探しの方のお役に立てれば幸いです。
2,アンナ・ネトレプコの「プリターニ」は、カラス、シルズ、サザーランド、カバレ、ゲンサーの芸術と技術に比べれば、はるかに劣っている。彼女には情熱がなく、トリルもなく、深くて豊かな高音もない。彼女のベストはロシアのレパートリーと、もしかしたら要求の少ないモーツァルトかもしれない。   METのライブで放送された「プリターニ」はまあまあだったが、すくい上げ、繰り返しの回避、機関車のようにパッセージを駆け抜ける、そして世界中のほとんどのオペラハウスの怒りを買うようなエンディング...またすくい上げ、そしてきついひどい高音...。このCDでも、同じようなテンタティヴネスがある。彼女の美しさと演技と魅力が大衆の興味を引くのであって、すべてを許される声ではないのだ。  アンナ・モッフォ、レニー・フレミング、M・カヴァレ、そしてもちろんマリア・カラスもそうだ。
1,Yo Nu-Mixxは最悪だ。Pacのような偉大なアーティストからお金を稼ぐためにこのようなCDを作る人がいるのは嫌だ。このCDはPacを軽視している。Pacのファンなら誰もこれを手に入れるべきじゃないね。彼らは素晴らしい曲を取り上げて、くだらないビートを作っている。パック嫌いを応援したいならこれを買え、もしくは金を無駄にするんだ。
1,わざわざこのレビューを書いて警告します：このCDは他のPutumayoのCDとは違います。このCDは、他のプツマヨのCDとは違います。このCDは、シナトラ・スタイルの陳腐な歌謡曲のセレクションで、偽の深い声を持つ様々な無愛想な男たちが歌っているのである。パスタの上でキスする犬のアニメを想像させるような音楽は、最低だ。警告を受けたと思いなさい。良い音楽が好きなら、代わりにフレンチカフェを試してみてください。
1,これがユーモア？ユーモアはいつから始まるのでしょうか？私は、これは面白くないと思う。この男のファンは家に帰ってバンジョーで配偶者を叩いて、私たちのことは放っておけばいいのかもしれませんね。
1,このエア・サプライは、もっと前に切るべきだった。  彼らの曲がラジオから流れてくると、すぐにシャットアウトしてしまう。  下手な耳コピは、彼らが録音したもの全てだ。  心にもないサッパリしたゴミだ。  ブレッドの音楽でさえ、これよりもっと面白かった。
1,このCDは本当にひどいもので、1万枚しか売れなくて、楽器代が払えないほどだ(笑)！これよりもっといいバンドがいるんだ。その一例がこのアルバムだ。
2,以下のレビューでは、決してハンクJr.を意図的に貶めているわけではなく、ただこのCDを正直にレビューしようとしているだけです。  このアルバムが再発売された当時、ハンクJr.はCMAやACMで大きな勝利を収め、絶好調だった。  彼はまた、彼のレコーディング・キャリアの中で最も高い評価を受けたカントリー・レコードをいくつかリリースしていました。  しかし、ある理由から、彼はロックンロールを録音する必要があると考えたのです。  私にとってこのCDは、ハンク・ウィリアムスJr.のライブ・コンサートのスタジオ録音版だ。  唯一の違いは、彼がライブでやるようなボーカルの失敗をしていないことだ。  音楽は明らかに80％カントリーではなく、80年代のロックに傾いている。    ハンク・ジュニアのレコーディング・キャリアをたどれば、このCDをきっかけに下降線をたどり、そこから抜け出し始めたと言えるでしょう。    しかし、このCDにはハンクの最後のトップ10ヒットの1つである「If the South Woulda Won」が収録されており、これは彼のコンピレーションでは入手困難な録音であることは言うまでもない。  この曲のために、このCDはコレクションとして必要不可欠なものだと言えるでしょう。
2,映画が大好きな7歳の姪に、このCDをプレゼントしたいと思いました。  まず画質を確認するために聴いてみました。音楽だけで、言葉が聞こえないので、とても驚きました。  音楽はいいのですが、彼女はあまり感心しないだろうと思いました。私たちは一緒に映画を見たし、レイさんの歌が大好きで、歌詞を知りたかった。  返品か売却しなければならないのが残念です。
1,これはプレスされるべきではなかった。  ミックスして捨てるべきでした。  買ってはいけない！
2,"Fly Me To The Moon』では歌がひどい。  私の言葉を鵜呑みにしないでください。  Amazon.comが提供する無料サンプルを聴いてみてください。  開始16秒、""all I worship and adore ""と歌うところで、彼女は数音にわたってほぼ全音尖らせているのです！  音楽的な訓練を受けていない人でも、それを聴き取ることができます。  他の曲は問題なく聴こえます"
5,オードラ・マクドナルドは絶対的な才能の持ち主だ。彼女が触れるものはすべて黄金に変わる。彼女が素晴らしいレコードを作ろうとして失敗したと言っている一部の人たちを、私はただ叩きたいだけだ。これは私たちが慣れ親しんでいるオードラではないかもしれないが、よく聴けば彼女は近くにいるのだ。だから、このCDはボーカル的に少し難易度が低いんだ。だから何だと言うのだ。私の好きなマクドナルドさんの特質は、彼女が歌っているものが何であれ、感情的に結びついていることです。彼女がきらきら星を録音しても、何度も聴きたくなるのは、彼女が物語を語っているからだ。だから、もしこのCDを買ったら、何度も聴いてみてください。このCDを買ったら、何度も聴いてみてください。Audra do her thang children.彼女に任せておけばいいんだ。
5,このアルバムを持っていないなら、ぜひ手に入れなければならない。このアルバムは、メイビー以来の最高のデビューアルバムです。quot;ゴールデンタッチ、quot;V.I.C.E.などのトラックは、最初の2秒からつま先を叩いてしまうような、バインディングquot;スタンブル・アンド・フォールを含め、アルバムのすべての曲がボンニフイドヒットと言うことができるだろう。もしあなたがリブレティンズや他のバンドが好きなら、またはただソリッドなCDを探しているなら、このアルバムは必需品です。
5,このベスト盤がすべての人にお勧めだとは言いません。私は彼女のすべてのアルバムを聴いたことがないので、真のファンなら、いくつかの曲が欠けていると感じるかもしれません。しかし、ポップスを本格的に始めたばかりの僕にとっては、このアルバムである程度満足しており、これは僕にとって5つ星のコレクションです。大好きな曲もあれば、全く好きでない曲もあり、あとは好きな曲ばかりです。私のお気に入りは順に、Erotica Ray of Light Beautiful Stranger The power of goodbye Deeper and Deeper Produtionは素晴らしく、ボーカルも大好きです。もしあなたがマドンナを初めて聴くなら、私の意見はここから始めるべきだと思います。でも、本当のファンなら、私にレッスンをしてくれるはずです。
4,アイアン・バタフライは、今日のヘヴィ・メタル・ロックの創始者の一人として、ロック界でユニークな存在となったパワー、ドライブ、そしてサウンドを持っている。このライブ・アルバムは、その事実を証明するものである。1960年代後半から1980年代半ばにかけてのライブ・コンサートの録音は、現在の基準からすると、せいぜい原始的なものであったが、このアイアン・バタフライのライブ録音は、その時代のチャート上位グループとしての全盛期の、グループの最高の音楽のほとんどを捉えている。これは、すべてのアイアン・バタフライ・ファンにとって「必需品」である。
5,"2006年12月7日、ミネアポリスのFirst Avenueで初めてMMW（with John Scofield）を観に行く前にこのCDを購入しました。  それまで彼らのことを聞いたことがなかったのですが、会場のウェブサイトにあるクリップが気に入りました。  それでチケットを買って、彼らが演奏することを知っていた ""Out Louder ""を手に入れて親しもうと思ったのですが、私がいた店では売り切れでした。  そこで、代わりに「End of the World」を購入しました。  最初は少しスペースが多すぎて好みではなかったのですが、それでも全体的なファンクネスが気に入りました。    それから...私は彼らのPLAYを見ました。  彼らのPLAYを見なければならない！」！  終わって欲しくなかったです！すぐにまた見たいと思いました！  それから1週間も経たないうちに、CDを2枚（「Out Louder」とScofieldの「A-Go-Go」で彼を「バックアップ」している）、さらに4枚をamazonから送ってもらい、これを書いているところです。  私は今、アディクトのようなものです！  車内でも家の中でも必ずつけています。  お店に行ってから車に戻ると、この音楽が流れていて、私の世界は再び正しくなりました。    Out Louder」と「A-Go-Go」は「End of the World」よりも好きですが、ほんの少しです。  シンセと他のゲストプレイヤーによってトリッピーになっていますし、何度か聴いているうちに、より好きになりました。  ただ、ゲストミュージシャンが少ないMMWの方が好きです。"
1,スティングがダウランドの音楽を心から賞賛し、愛していることは間違いないのだが、この演奏では無理がある。彼は明らかに注意深く音を覚えていて、これらの難しい曲の一つ一つをやり遂げている...しかし、ぎりぎりだ。  しかし、これらの演奏のどれもが、本当に飛び立ち、舞い上がり、真の解釈となることはない。  しかし、これらの演奏は、決して飛び立ち、舞い上がり、真の解釈となることはない。  公平を期すために、スティングの声にはあまりにも近い「ポップ」なマイキングが施され、まるで彼と優れたルーテニスト、エディン・カラマーゾフが同じ部屋にいないかのような演奏になっています。さらに、スティングの鼻にかかったような発声と奇妙な色の母音は、高度に詩的なテキストをほとんど理解できないものにしがちである。  さらに、ジョン・ダウランドがエリザベス1世の最高顧問であったロバート・セシル卿に宛てた手紙を、スティングが「名作劇場」風に読み上げるという陳腐な演出や、不用意なマルチトラック効果も加わり、全体としてはすぐに聴けなくなる。  というのも、このディスクの48分という短い演奏時間でさえも、もっと長く感じられるからだ。  私は、このディスクのためにお金を払わずに済んでよかったと思っています。地元の貸出図書館で借りたのですが、週明けに戻ってきます。
4,"moveon.orgとmusicforamerica.comのサイトを見て、お金を出す価値のある活動かどうかを自分で判断してください。そうであれば、この先を読み、そうでなければ、他のものを見てください。   主に「インディーズ」アーティストに焦点を当てているとはいえ、このアルバムはかなり多様で、それは良いことでもあり悪いことでもある（ブラック・アイド・ピーズのウィル・アイ・アムによる典型的なジャズポップ・ラップの曲に続いて、ザ・マイト・ビー・ジャイアンツが1840年代のウィリアム・ヘンリー・ハリスンの選挙歌をカバーするというのは誰のアイデアだったのだろう）。ハイライトは、前述のTMBGの曲、OKGOの驚くほど繊細なThe Zombies「This Will Be Our Year」のカバー、元Soul CoughingのボーカルMike Doughtyの「Move On」、ローラ・カントレルのカントリークラシック「Sam Stone」の心に残る演奏、故エリオット・スミスの「A Distorted Reality・・・」、彼の遺作となった「From The Basement On The Hill」にまもなく収録予定である。Fountains Of Wayneの ""Everything's Ruined ""のアコースティックな演奏は、彼らのデビューアルバムに収録されたあまりにも淡白なオリジナルを改善したものだが、Blink 182のリミックスはオリジナルとほとんど変わらない（そもそも良い曲ではない）、Bright Eyesのライブトラックは耳障りに引き延ばされる、Yeah Yeahsのライブバージョン ""Date With The Night ""も不透明で彼らの狂気に満ちたライブをうまく捉えることはできなかった。コンピレーションとして、このアルバムにはいくつかの欠点があり、別バージョンやライブ音源が少し詰め込まれすぎているが、全体として、少なくとも一握りのバンドが好きで、また、この目的を信じているならば、購入に値するだけの良い素材を持っている。"
4,"ボックスセットではないので、（必然的に）私が持っていない曲も含まれていますが、これはトム・スコットの70年代の「全盛期」の良いサンプラーであり、特にクランク・イット・アップの &quot;Gotcha&quot; (Starsky &; Hutch TV theme song) やソウルな &quot;Shadows,&quot; などがあります。  Blow It Out&quot;が収録されていないのは残念だが、全体としてはシングルアルバム1枚分のトム・スコットの良さがある（最高ではない）。  70年代のフュージョンが好きなら、これは気に入るはずです。  確かに$の価値はある。"
1,"私は何年もフランク・シナトラを聴いてきたが、この手のものは冷めるばかりだ。むしろ彼自身に聞きたいくらいだ...。  あるいは、この素材に全く異なるアプローチをするのであれば、シャマス・ダークのような完全にオリジナルなアプローチをする人、そして彼のアルバム「Songs For Suicidal Lovers」は、素晴らしい曲に忠実でありながら、これまでに聴いたことのないようなサウンドです。www.evolutionofmedia.com が言っていたように：""...オーラル・フィルム・ノワール...ダークサイドに分け入る..."
5,"プリンスの1981年のアルバム『CONTROVERSY』もまた、彼のカタログに載る名盤である。早速、タイトル曲が目立ちます。シングル・バージョンよりも長いこのバージョンは、祈りをフィーチャーしている。この曲はファンキーで効果的だ。""Sexuality ""は素晴らしいディスコ／ファンク・ナンバーだ。""Do Me, Baby ""は、おそらく彼の曲の中で最もセクシーな曲の一つだろう。このフルレングス・ヴァージョンが聴きものだ。""Private Joy ""もファンキーな曲で、このアルバムの中でもう1つのお気に入りである。""Ronnie, Talk To Russia ""は、短いプロテスト的な曲だ。ジョン・レノンの射殺事件、ロナルド・レーガン、アトランタの児童殺傷事件などについて書いた「Annie Christian」もそうだ。Ronnie, Talk To Russia」ほど効果的ではないが、それでもまともな曲である。全体的にプリンスのキャリアの中でハイライトとなる作品だ。"
1,このCDは、良い評判が多く、説明も楽しめそうだったので購入しました。しかし、それは非道いCDであることが判明しました。このCDは、全体を通して非常に反復的で単調です。曲はほとんどすべて同じに聞こえる。メロディーのバリエーションはほとんどなく、ボーカルには基本的に音域がない。歌詞は極めてセンスがない。中古で安く買えたのでよかったです。このまま手放すか、捨ててしまうか、わからないくらいひどい。
2,このCDは、JMMのソリッドな曲群を期待して購入しました。  しかし、このアルバムは、良い素材という点では本当に欠けている。目立つような曲は1つもないし、何度も再生する価値のある曲もない。  アルバム全体が、「あなたの[リアエンド]から花を咲かせる」タイプの曲で占められているのです。タイトルカットの「Pictures」は、家族の写真を撮るのが好きで、もっと撮るのを楽しみにしている男の話です。  8歳の子供が書いたような曲です。  このCDで15ドルを無駄にするよりも、パット・グリーンかブラッド・ペイズリーのCDを買ったほうがずっと価値がある。
4,"私は何年も前から子供たちにTMBGの音楽を「聴かせていた」のですが、もう「聴かせる」必要はありません。  私の6歳と7歳の子供たちは、""No!""、""Clap Your Hands""、""Four of Two ""といった曲を実際に「聴きたい」と思っています。  これはTMBGのベストCDではありませんが（「フラッド」だと言う人もいます）、私の子供にとって一番好きなTMBGのCDです"
5,このCDは、本当にあなたを成長させてくれるでしょう。だから、最終的な判断を下す前に何度も聴いてみてください。ヴァン・モリソンのベストの一つです。  このCDは、ほとんど自伝的であるように見えることがある。特にSTRANDED...JUST LIKE GRETA...THEY SOLD ME OUT。彼のジャズのバックグラウンド、アイルランドのバックグラウンド、ブルースのバックグラウンド...すべてがこのCDの中に存在している。
2,私は通常、高評価の音楽に自分の意見を付け加えることはしませんが、この気まぐれな世界では、あなたは前作と同じくらい良いものでしかなく、あなたが次のアルバムを出すまで半世紀待たなければならないので、これはより悪いことです。私はSadeのコンサートをよく見ますが、彼女はいつも素晴らしいサウンドを持っていました。壊れていないなら、直さない方がいい。
1,私たちがパンクスだった頃、蓄音機を囲んで、エジソンのシリンダーでプッチーニを聴いていたのを覚えていますか？4分の音楽が聴けるんだ！4分もあるんだ！それからヒッピーのオペラ歌手、エンリコ・カルーソが現れて、若いパンクスたちはみんな彼の歌を聴いていたよ。彼はとてもいい歌手だった。でも、私が幼いころは、音楽といえばコンサートしかなかったんです。フランツ・リストがコンサートでピアノを弾くのを見たのを覚えています。とても素晴らしいヴィルトゥオーゾで、ヨハン・シュトラウスJr.がオーケストラを指揮していました。   その後、蓄音機と呼ばれるものが登場し、さらに近代的なものになりました。蓄音機の改良版が登場し、若いパンクスや怠け者の子供たちがこぞって聴くようになったからです。つまり、蓄音機のようにハンドルを回す必要もないんです。しかも、1枚のレコードに1時間、60分もの音楽が収録されているんだよ？ぷしゅー！4分もあれば十分なのに、それでもまだウンザリしていた。私の時代は、午後4時に寝て、午前2時に朝食をとり、それから炭鉱に行くという生活だった。60分の自由時間なんてなかった。   今の音楽はどんな形をしているのか、私にはわからない。蓄音機の後、いくつか他のものが出てきたようだ。今、私が目にするのは、おしゃれなアイポッド(？)やMP3、MP4プレーヤーと呼ばれるものを持った子供たちが、「ヒップホップ」なるおふざけを聴いている姿だけです。音楽とは呼べない、ただのノイズだ。さて、そろそろ寝る準備をしないと、もう3時45分だ。
4,タバサ、アテナ、ラヴォン、私の女性はすべてあなたたち3人のために残しておくわ。  音楽の話をしよう、Surrender、I Like、Keep On、Giving You My Love Again、Keith Sweatとの曲もいい音してますね。  彼女たちはSWVやジェイドのようなグループの域に達していた。  いいクラスだと思う。
1,RelientK、Academy is、Everytime I Die、From First to Last、Underoath、Matchbook Romance、Saves the Dayはこのツアーをサポートしない理由だ（NOFX、Casualties、Time Againを見るためだけに行く人たちのために）・・・Bad religionとRancidは今回ここに入っていないことを本当に褒める！このツアーは去年より断然悪い...でも何を期待してるんだ？過去3年間のこのツアーは落ち目だった...つまり、これに参加する良いバンドは、これを買ったり40ドルのチケットを買ったりしたいと思うほどの苦悩や嫌悪感に見合わない。僕にとっては詐欺だ...僕はみんながワープしたツアーを「パンク」ツアーと呼ぶのをやめて本当にうれしい...もしNOFXがトレンディなシーンスターたちから大量のブーイングを浴びたら、彼らでさえこの「ニューエモ」トレンドが一体何なのかを理解できるかもしれない。しかし、そのどれもが、ビル・ジョー（ブレーンレス）・アームストロングが深い感銘を与える人物であることを認めるに違いない。これを究極の駄作の山にするために本当に足りないのは、フォールアウトボーイ、シンプルプラン、イエローカード、ブリンク182、グッドシャーロット、ニュースクールAFiだ。要するに...ペストのように避け、来年は良い方向に変わるかもしれない！...でもほとんどの場合は悪くなる、だけど、ちょっと、不思議なことは起きたんだ。
2,私は70年代後半にこのアルバムが大好きだったのですが、amazonで再び購入しました。.意外とグルーヴが荒い。真のクラシックではない、私はそう思った。
1,"""22曲で74分もあるこの『Cripple Crow』は、絶望的に自己中心的な作品だ。短いけれども可愛らしい「Dragonflies」のように、バンハートがクオリティコントロールを行う場面では、マッカートニーのようなメロディックな技巧を垣間見ることができるのだが、それは残念なことである。しかし、一般的に、バンハートは、機知に欠けた蛇行と刺激的なストーナー・ドローで、あなたの貴重な時間を1時間15分も浪費しているときが最も幸せなのだ。""今年はすでにAmadou & Mariamの素晴らしいレコードを聴いたが、プロデューサーであるManu Chaoは西洋のポップセンスとエスニックサウンドを見事に融合させ、新鮮で爽快な音楽を作り出している。それに比べると、バンハートのワールド／フォーク・ミュージックへの理解力のなさは、粗悪で派手な汗水たらして作った偽物のように見えてしまう。""  ゴアのタワーレコードで今月一番の売れ筋だろう、しかし。"
5,ファンがキラーズの新しいサウンドとルックスを受け入れるかどうか、何の騒ぎになっているのかわからないが、私は大好きだ！このアルバムを3回目に聴いたとき、Hot Fussのように長い間聴き続けることはできないだろうと思いました。曲は素晴らしいし、フックは最高だし、完璧なまでに洗練されている。
1,このCDを購入しましたが、ぼったくられました。CDに収録されている音は哀れなものです。サウンドブースに一人立っているような、質の悪いものです。自分でテープレコーダーとマイクを使って、もっと良い録音ができたはずだ。私は、お化け屋敷で使う音の羅列を編集するためにCDを探していたのです。今、私はこれらの音を得るための別の手段を見つけなければならない。このCDは買わないでください。あなたのお金の価値はありません。
1,私のような皮肉屋で人間嫌いの人間が、一体何を期待しているのでしょうか。  花のような泡のような暖かい太陽の光？  とんでもない！  リル・ジョンのような人がいるからこそ、私は病的な思考になるのです。  精神病院から追放されたような、特別支援学校の落第生が大金を得ているのを見ると、私は少し悲観的になってしまうのです。  しかし、私を責めることができますか？  まじめな話、頭をしっかりねじ込んで、ちょっと考えてみよう。まともな人が、なぜこのCDを実際に聴いたり、実際に購入したりするのだろうか？  これは完全にジョークだ。  私は見たままを言っただけだ。  リル・ジョンは、どんな人間からも尊敬されるに値しない。    リル・ジョンをエルモに例えるなら、エルモは操り人形だが、その技量は数百万倍もある。  少なくともエルモは、子供たちが楽しく遊べる、健全で良い子供向けのアイコンです。  もし私に子供ができたら、エルモは今でも子供たちに大人気だろうが、リル・ジョンは、彼の「ファン」たちが大人になって、彼が「音楽」として流したゴミを実際に買ったことがいかに愚かだったかに気づけば、今でも笑われることだろう。  というわけで、このレビュー（過去6回分と同様）は、どうせ掲載されないだろう。
1,目覚まし時計は3時40分にセットしています。スーパーヒーローの下着はかっこいい。CDドライブが点滅する。火災報知器で脳震盪を起こした。子犬は世界を征服するだろう。ワンダーウーマンはスーパーマンをやっつけるだろう。U r the coolest person in the world.こんな無駄なレビュを見てくれてありがとう
4,この人は本当にSupertrampをたくさん聴いて育ってきたんだな、と。  私はこのアルバムが好きだが、ここに収録されている曲の約半分には、程度の差こそあれ、スーパートランプのスタイルのヒントがあるように感じられる。  特に「Bad Day」は、「Breakfast in America」のアルバムに収録されているようなサウンドだ。  それでもこのアルバムは、特にSupertrampが好きな人なら、楽しめると思います。  レオ・セイヤーのフックは分かるが、ちょっとずれている気がする。  レオはあんなにたくさんのキーボードを使わなかった。
1,注文したのは2006年1月6日です。
1,曲はどうしても踊れませんでした。  正直言って、がっかりしました。  でも、Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2は大好きなのですが、発売されていなかったので買うことができませんでした。
1,今朝は水煮を聴いていました。このアルバムより好みでした
1,ヒンダーのリードボーカルは、トイレで便秘しているときにしか録音しないというのは本当ですか？彼の声はそう聞こえる。天使の唇」の歌い方は、彼の顔を殴りたくなる！このグループを聴くくらいなら、陰毛についた乾燥した精液を摘み取る方がましだ。仕事中、サビを聞く前にラジオに向かい局を変えようとして、マジでつまづいて転びそうになったよ！
5,この音楽はとてもとても素晴らしいです。  とてもエネルギーがあり、楽しいです。  子供たちは、これが「ジャズ」アルバムであることなど気にも留めず、この音楽が大好きで、幸せな気分にさせてくれることを知っています。  子供向けの音楽でお金を浪費したり、子供の知性とあなたの耳を侮辱したりしないで、二人が楽しめるものを買ってあげてください。  私たちのお気に入りは、「ドゥードゥル」と「ポテトチップス」です。  1ペニー（約100円）以上の価値があります。
5,今まで聴いた子供向けCDの中でもトップクラスです。  曲はどれもキャッチーで、聴いていて楽しいです。  ジャズの入門編としても最適です
5,ザ・マイト・ビー・ジャイアンツ初のメジャーレーベルのアルバムである。  インディペンデント・レーベルのアルバムで確立したサウンドを継承し、さらに発展させた。  TMBGの中で最も人気のあるアルバムだろう。  Birdhouse in Your Soul」、「Istanbul」、「Particle Man」など、TMBGの名曲が数多く収録されている。  ジョンズから期待されているキャッチーなメロディーとバカバカしい歌詞がぎっしり詰まっています。  すべてのThey Might Be Giantsファン必携の1枚です。
5,うちの22ヶ月の子供は、パパやママが我慢して聴く子供向けの曲より、この音楽が大好きです。
5,"Hot Hot HeatのMake up the Breakdownは、Knock Knockに続く作品です。個人的には、Hot Hot Heatの大ファンなら、最も好きなアルバムのひとつになるはずです。一曲一曲がユニークで、踊りたくなるようなキャッチーなビートが特徴です。1曲目の『Naked in the City Again』は最高です。  2曲目のNo, Not Nowは、思わず動き出さずにはいられない人気曲です。Get in or Get outはキーボードのパートが最高にRADなんです。このアルバムの最大のヒット曲であるBandagesは、Hot Hot Heatのキャリアを後押しするような曲で、この1曲だけでこのアルバムを購入する価値があると思います。Oh Goddamnitはとても素晴らしい曲で、歌詞もとても楽しいので、一緒に歌ってしまうこと間違いなしです。次の曲Avedaは、多くの人が疑問に思っていることです：元カノかヘアプロダクトか？どちらにしても、この曲は楽しめると思います。この街は、多くの人がクレイジーなファンについて書かれたものだと信じていますが、聴いてみて自分で判断してください。Talk to Me, Dance with Meも大ヒットし、ファンをHot Hot Heatにさせた。この曲は、私を踊らせ、歌わせ、その他あらゆることをお気に入りの曲に合わせてさせてくれます。Save us S.O.S.では、リードシンガー、スティーブ・ベイズの声の深みが気に入り、心が溶けるような気持ちになります。Hot Hot Heatの通常の曲とは全く違うが、In Cairoも素晴らしい曲で、Make up the Breakdownの素晴らしいエンディングを飾っている。このCDは何時間でもステレオに置いておけるだろう。曲は中毒性があるので、このアルバムは間違いなくお金を払う価値がある。"
5,素晴らしいハーモニー、素晴らしい声、美しい音楽。  このグループはもっと知られてもいいし、大成功してもいいはずだ
1,私が初めてAntony and the Johnsonsを知ったのは、Rufus Wainwrightのことを教えてくれた友人からで、とても素晴らしい新しいアーティストを聴いていたそうです。  私は地元のBarnes & NobleでこのAntonyについて調べてみることにしたのですが、そこで発見したのはとても、とても残念なことでした。  音楽は楽器的によくできていて、レイヤーも非常によくできているのですが、アントニーの声は非常に大げさで、偽物なのです。  偽物の声というのは、ビブラートの使い方のことで、非常に速く、無理矢理で羊のような（自然ではない）方法で使われているのです。  プロの声楽家たちは、ビブラートの正しい使い方は、1秒間に5～6回の振動を与えることだと教えています。  アントニーの「訓練された」響きの声は、この領域ではまったく訓練されていないことがわかる。  このバンドとレコードについて、私が非常に恐ろしいと思うもう一つの点は、曲の歌詞です。  このアーティストは、自分の性別に戸惑い、あるいは後悔しているようで、悲痛な叫びを表現している。  この歌詞は、聴き手にとって何の魅力も関係もなく、そのために聴き手は、音楽そのものを哀れみ、ほとんど迷惑に思ってしまう。  私の結論は、これはひどいレコードであり、この歌手はプロのボイスレッスンを受ける必要がある...そして助けを求める。
5,"セント・エルスホェアは、クラブ・ビートのエネルギーと、シーローのソウルフルな（そして時には切ない）声、そして示唆に富む歌詞が組み合わさっている。フレンティックな ""Go-Go Gospel ""から内省的な ""Just a Thought ""まで、さまざまなスタイルが楽しめる。購入の必需品です。"
2,この音楽は、タイトル通り、「クラシック」という言葉で説明・定義することができます。私はこの音楽が、クラブで何年もかけて演奏されてきた曲の歴史を持つ、非常にクラブ的な素材になると思っていました。CDの大部分は、ゴシックな「クラブ」素材とは思えず、特にタイプ-Oを投入しています。このCDにはとても失望しました。あちこちで何曲か聴きましたが、もしあなたが古いものに興味があるなら、これはあなたのためのものです。
4,Gothic ClubのミックスCDを家に置いてきてしまったので、これを買うことにしました。まずハマったのは、バウハウスの「Bela Lugosi's Dead」のライブ録音で、これはクラシックなゴス音楽です。好きなバンドもあれば、そうでないバンドもありますが、全体としてこれは素晴らしいCDです。私のお気に入りは2枚目のCDに収録されている「Sheryl」です。このCDは、冷やかしに、ダンスに、あるいは無教養な大衆にゴス音楽の本当の姿を見せるのに最適なCDです。
2,"トニー・ヤヨの『Thoughts of a Predicate Felon』は、トニー・ヤヨがこのアルバムで自分が何者なのか（あるいは何者であるべきなのか）わからないという事実に苦しんでいる。このアルバムを聴く前、私はヤヨの犯罪生活に関する硬質で描写的な韻を踏むことを期待していた。しかし、残念なことに、私も多くの人と同じように、""Tattle Teller""、""Curious""、""Project Princess ""などのトラックに耳を傾けてしまった。前科者であるヤヨが、もっとハードコアなもの、もっと良いものを期待している聴衆に対して、このようなメッセージを発信するのはいかがなものか。Live By The Gun ""や ""Homicide ""などのトラックで、ヤヨは私が前述した「よりハードな」歌詞を望んでいることを表現しているが、このようなトラックはほとんどないだろう。トニー・ヤヨが次のアルバムでこのようなことに集中できることを望むが、今のところ、このデビュー・アルバムは単に期待外れであった。"
1,このアルバムはつまらないと思う。仕事をしてないんじゃないかと思う。Lil Jonはワナビーだと思う。彼らは本当の仕事を得る必要があると思う。このアルバムは、買ってすぐに壊れてしまったと思う。このCDは、ほとんどのCDプレーヤーで再生できないと思う。私はこれを勧めないと思う。もう十分だと思う。私は今、地獄に落ちていると思う。どうせそうだろう魂を売ったんだから
4,このアルバムは、65歳にしてチャートのトップに立った伝説の人物による傑作です。ディランは非凡な才能を持ち、年を重ねるごとにさらに良くなっているように思える。どの曲も格別で、彼の素晴らしい才能と作曲能力を示している。
5,"この曲を初めて聴いたのは、去年の夏、家のペンキ塗りをしているときでした。新鮮な空気と太陽の下で（そして最近結婚した）、この曲はすぐに私の興味を引き、聴くたびにますます魅力的になっていくようでした。この曲は、（サビの部分は）やや「ロック」と呼べるかもしれませんが、この曲の憧れ、情熱的な愛の要素を伝えているのは、アレックス・バンドのボーカルです。彼は、この曲をただのロックソングにするのではなく、ロマンチックでユニークなものにすることに成功しています。チャドのボーカルはアレックスと大差ないのですが（どちらも男性的で力強い）、チャドのバージョンは「良い曲」であり、アレックスの歌唱は「素晴らしい曲」に仕上がっていると感じます。チャドの声は他の曲では素晴らしいのですが、このタイプの曲では、過度に威圧的で怒ったような声になっています。女性の立場からすると、アレックスの歌い方だと「付き合おう」と思わせることができるのに、チャドの歌い方だと「怖い」と思ってしまう！時には、一人のヴォーカリストがその曲を歌うことが「運命」であり、その曲を作るか壊すかのどちらかであることもある。1999年の ""Smooth ""を思い浮かべてください。ロブ・トーマスの歌唱は、あの曲をヒットさせるのに貢献した。この場合、アレックスはその仕事に最適な人物だ。"
5,"アーロ・ガスリー、タジ・マハル、ティム・オブライエンといったフォークシーンを代表するアーティストに、ブルーグラス奏者のティム・オブライエン、ロンダ・ヴィンセント、ブルースピックのケブ・モ、ガイ・デイビス、エリック・ビブ、そしてロジー・フローレスといったアメリカーナ・カントリーの面々が加わった素晴らしいキッズミュージックセットです...。素晴らしいラインナップであることは確かですが、それ以上にソングライティングの質の高さ、そして実際に子供たちに親しまれていることが重要なのです。  これは本当に楽しいアルバムです！  このアルバムは本当に楽しいアルバムです！楽しいというのは、小さな子供たちが実際にこのアルバムを気に入るかもしれないということであり、もしあなたが彼らにこのアルバムを聞かせたら一緒に歌うかもしれません。  ブリングブラング」、「バナナフォン」、「ベリーボタンソング」など、くだらない曲がたくさんある。  また、""Red, Red Robin ""のように元気な曲もあれば、""Man Named All The Animals ""のように教訓的な曲もあり、さらに、タジ・マハールの素晴らしい ""Don't You Push Me Down ""のように自己主張やコミュニケーションのスキルを模した曲もあり、不快な状況で様々な子供たちが自分自身を主張し、そのような曲もあります。  私はこのアルバムがとても好きで、これから何年も子供に聴かせようと思っている。"
5,今回のダニエルは最高です。1982年の今、あなたがまだ「アーチー・バンカーズ・プレイス」に出演していたらと思うと。かわいそうに、これからは私があなたのメインレビュアーになりますよ。なぜ、その素晴らしい声と演技の才能をニューヨークに隠しているんだ。カリフォルニア州モロベイのMirror Vision Inc.で働かせたいくらいだ。レコード会社で働かせたい。近いうちにコンサートでお会いする予定ですが、良い秋をお過ごしでしょうか。私はよくあなたのことを考え、いつも他の人にあなたの明るい星のことを話します、私はもっとあなたのことを考えたい、あなたは私に会ったことがなく、私たちは遠くなったことを知っていますが、あなたはまだ私の人生の謎です、私のためにあなたのお父さんとお母さんにこんにちはと言ってください、私はカリフォルニア州モロベイからあなたに会いたい、（私はあなたを愛しています）ラブガー
5,"1975年、ジョー・ジャクソンは、子供たちのキャリアを管理するモータウン・レコードにうんざりしていました。そこで彼は、子供たちをエピック・レコードに移籍させた。そこで、モータウンのヘンリー・コスビー、ハル・デイヴィス、さらにベリー・ゴーディーに支配されることなく、エピックは彼らの指揮をフィリデルフィア・ファンク・マイスターのケネス・ギャンブルとレオン・ハフに引き継いだ。彼らは、テディ・ペンダーグラス、MFSB、ハロルド・メルヴィンとブルーノーツ、マクファデンとホワイトヘッドなど、とてつもない成功を収めた。  彼らはジャクソンズのオリジナル曲をスタジオに持ち込み、フィリー・マジックを駆使して、史上最高のソウル・レコードを完成させた。最初から最後まで、""The Jacksons ""は、""Enjoy Yourself ""から始まり、ファンカデリックな ""Style Of Life ""で締めくくる、ファンキーなファンクフェストの頂点から次へとあなたを連れて行きます。子供の頃、このレコードを聴いて、当初は「Good Times」はジャクソンズがあのテレビ番組のテーマをリメイクしたものだと思っていました。しかし、それは純粋なスローファンクだった。Phunk-da-fied-、Phunkalicious、あるいはただ単にPhantastic、The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat。"
5,私は68歳で、長年のスチュワートファンですが、これは彼のベストの1つです。  他のレビュアーと何が問題なのかわからない。
5,"もしイアン・カーティスが自分の人生のプラグを抜かなかったらどうなっていただろう？  私はジョイ・ディヴィジョンの熱烈なファンですが、ニュー・オーダーの良きファンでもありますから、この質問は難しいですね。  ジョイ・ディヴィジョンはあと1枚か2枚アルバムを作って解散していたかもしれない、と想像しています：ニュー・オーダーは存在しなかったかもしれない。  だから、カーティスが自殺したことは悲劇的だが、ジョイ・ディヴィジョンの残りのメンバーには、ニュー・オーダーとして効果的に再出発するための道が与えられた。  このバンドはJDとは全く異なるが、ニュー・オーダーの最初の作品である「Power, Corruption Lies」では、JDの面影を感じさせるとともに、苦悩とカタルシスの結果であろう新しい創造性を爆発させている。    このアルバムの音楽は、JDのどの作品よりもシンセとドラムを多用したものだが、後のニュー・オーダーの作品ほどではないかもしれない。  1983年にはシンセサイザーとドラムマシンが本領を発揮し、この年にシンセサイザー用のMIDIインターフェースが発明された。また、ニューウェーブ・ムーブメントがようやく固まりつつあった時期でもある。  歴史はさておき、このアルバムは素晴らしい。アップビートで、ポップなダンス・トラックが満載で、まさにニューウェーブの名盤だ。  もしあなたが「Blue Monday」（Orgyのようなひどいバンドでさえヒットさせることができたほど良い曲）のためだけにこのアルバムを買おうとしているなら、本当に驚かされることになりますよ。他の曲も素晴らしいものがたくさんあることに気づくだろう。  「Age of Consent」は私のお気に入りの1つです。  この曲もダンスに最適な曲です。  また、""the Village ""も素晴らしいトラックです。  もしNew Orderのアルバムを2枚買うなら、このアルバムとSubstanceを買ってください。  いくつかの曲は共通ですが、どちらも素晴らしいです。  でも、このアルバムの方が圧倒的に再生回数が多いんだ。  ニューオーダーファンはもちろんだが、ニューウェーブ/'sファンも必携の1枚だ。  しかし、ニューウェーブ/80年代音楽のファンやジョイ・ディヴィジョンのファンも同様にこのアルバムを買うべきでしょう。  このアルバムは、その20年の人生の中で、非常に多くの賞賛を受け、大きな影響を与えたので、現代の音楽ファンなら必ず持っているはずです。  私は強くお勧めする！  -- テッド・ムレーナ"
5,このCDは家族みんなで楽しめるのがいいですね。曲はキャッチーで、知らない人の周りで歌っているのがバレても大したことはない！
2,このCDを手に入れるのが本当に待ち遠しかった。  とても気に入りたいと思いました。  しかし--私にはあまりにもブルーグラス的なのです。  一曲一曲。  1曲か2曲ならいいのですが、どの曲も飽きます。  それに、録音品質もそれほど良くないようです。  言葉はほとんど聞こえないし、ほとんどの子どもは一緒に歌いたがる。  ジェニー・ジェンキンスは楽しい曲だし、シェネンドアは心にしみるほど美しいが、フォー・ザ・キッズやNO！の方がずっと良いCDだ
5,このアルバムは今でも楽しんでいます。どの曲もいいのですが、Hold On、You don't have to worry、Don't Goなど、他の曲より聴くことが多い曲があります。  このアルバムは素晴らしいアルバムで、すぐに売ったり交換したりするつもりはない。
5,このディスクのクルセイダーズの音は最高だ。音楽もアレンジもずっとうまくいっている。
5,エドウィン・マケインという名前がついているものなら、信じて買うべき素晴らしい製品です。彼の作る曲は、心を揺さぶり、インクの一滴一滴まで忠実に再現されています。
1,アリソン・ムーラーの最新作「Getting Somewhere」は、素晴らしい「The Duel」に続く、巨大な、巨大な失望である。率直に言って、「Getting Somewhere」に収録されている曲は、弱々しく、根性がない。  ムーラーは「The Duel」の美しさと感触を模倣しようとしているが、例えば「Hallelujah」や「New Years Day」のように、アールは素人的で陳腐で薄いプロダクションで素材の心を引き裂き、騙されたと感じるほどだ！ムーラーはこのリリースをじっくり見て、次回はRSフィールドの再インストールを真剣に検討すべきです。  もしMoorerが、燃えるようなギターグルーヴ、ドライブするドラム、魅惑的なボーカルを求めるなら、Earleはこの仕事には向かないだろう。  ムーラーは、あらゆるジャンルの中で最も優れた女性の声の持ち主であり、素晴らしい才能を持っている（彼女は意地の悪い歌も書ける！）。このCDは、彼女の能力を全く発揮していないので、すぐにバーゲン・ビンに入れるべきだ。
1,このアルバムのレビューのほとんどは、誰も知らない新しい素晴らしいジャンルやサウンドを発見したと思って特別な気分に浸っている人たちが書いているような気がするんだ。  君たちには悪いけど、このサウンドは90年代半ばからあったんだ。  Neutral Milk Hotelと呼ばれ、Decemberistsと呼ばれる詐欺師たちよりもはるかに優れていたのだ。  私の意見に反対する前に、ニュートラル・ミルク・ホテルの『In the Aeroplane over the Sea』（1997年）を手に取って、それから反対してみてほしい。
5,"Carbon Leafのサウンドは進化を続けており、その結果は素晴らしいものです。バンドは、自分たちの音楽スタイルを「定義」することはあきらめたと言います。なぜなら、それは多くの影響とオリジナルのアイディアの移り変わるブレンドだからです。これまでCarbon Leafは、ルーツ的なフォークロックにケルト、ブルーグラス、アルトポップの要素を加えたバリエーションを演奏してきました。この新しいアルバムは、クリーンでありながら印象的なストレートなポップ・ロック・サウンドに重点を置いています。その一方で、バラエティに富んでいる：例えば、""Block of Wood ""はカントリーロック的な華やかさを持ち、""International Airport ""はジャズ的な要素を含んでいる。全体として、これはバンドのブレイクアルバムにふさわしい、洗練された逸品です。  曲は、魅力的なもの（「Bright Lights」、「Love Loss Hope Repeat」）からアンセミックなもの（「Learn to Fly」、「Comfort」）、悲痛なもの（「Block of Wood」）、ユーモアなもの（「A Girl and Her Horse」）、深遠なもの（「The War Was in Color」）まで多岐にわたっています。もしあなたが感染力のあるメロディー、見事なハーモニー、示唆に富み、しばしばほろ苦い歌詞、美しい楽器編成、そして原始的で精巧に作られたプロダクションが好きなら、このアルバムはきっと気に入るはずです。   アコースティックなリズム・ギターを多用し、繊細なエレキ・ギターのリフやフィル（テリー・クラークとカーター・グラヴァット）できちんと装飾し、キラーリズム・セクション（ベースのジョーダン・メダスとドラムのスコット・ミルステッド）に支えられ、マンドリン（再びグラヴァット）のタッチもある。このアルバムでは、ゲストミュージシャンのティム・ラウアーによるキーボードワークが、カーボンリーフの初期の作品よりも少し多めになっています。そして、リード・シンガーのバリー・プリヴェット（全曲作詞作曲）の澄んだ、響くような、時には催眠術のような歌声が、すべてを包み込んでいます。  この作品は、ガスターの「Ganging Up on the Sun」と並んで、私が2006年にリリースした作品の中で最も気に入っている作品です。カーボン・リーフの新しいファンも長年のファンも、この『Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat』には多くの喜びがある。"
4,正当なヒット曲が1曲しかないグループのベストヒットパッケージで私が好きなのは、飽きがこないことだ。Timbuk 3のベスト盤は、彼らの音楽を楽しむための良いきっかけになるし、ラジオで何度も聴いたことのある曲でも飽きることはないだろう。もしバンドについてもっと情報が欲しいなら、少なくとも1つの素晴らしいウェブサイトがあるので、ウェブで検索してみてください。このCDとライブ盤を買ったら、中古のゴミ箱を探さなければならないだろう。
5,"このサウンドトラックは素晴らしいです。cdを聴いていてスキップする曲は1つもありません。  馴染みのあるアーティストと馴染みのないアーティストが歌う最近の曲と古い曲のミックスは最高です。  Anita Nalick, Breathe (2a.m.)は、アルバムの値段以上の価値があります。"
5,私は長い間、アルバムを買っていません。なぜなら、オンライン海賊版がある中で、誰が余分なお金を使う必要があるのでしょうか？でも、これは買わなきゃいけないんだ。  ファインスタインの声はとてもピュアで多彩です。ある瞬間は面白く、次の瞬間には胸を打つようなほろ苦さがあります。彼のパフォーマンスは一級品で、ライブコンサートでこれだけ歌えるということを考えなければならない。  
4,私はクリスマスCDを100枚くらい持っていますが（趣味です）、「Explicit Lyrics」の警告があるのはこれだけだと思います！  これは「Here Comes Fatty Claus」という1曲だけで、「sh*t」という言葉がかなり目立つように使われているためです。  私はかなり幼い子供がいるので、その曲の入っていないCDを焼きました。彼女はそれを気に入っています！  CDについては...かなりいい感じです。ウォーターズは、私が知る限りユニークな、キャンピークリスマスソングのベストを集めることに成功しました。    でも、ただのノベルティCDじゃないんだ...曲がいいんだよ。これは意図的なキャンプではありません...タイニー・タイムの曲を除いては、誠実なものなのです。(よくできているので、娘のお気に入りの一つです。
1,Fiddy Centだけでは物足りないのか、Kayne Westのこの恐ろしいトレンドがやってきました。今まで言われたことのないことを言う必要があるのでしょうか？何もありません。私の仕事は、一つ星のレビュアーたちがやってくれました。私が言いたいのは、このラッパーが遅かれ早かれ宇宙から消えていくことを願うということだけです。  良いラップが欲しい？トゥパック（R.I.P.）かパブリック・エネミーをどうぞ。
1,"ほとんどの人が、このアルバムをチープ・トリックの「カムバック・アルバム」だと考えていた。  しかし、16年経った今、私はこのアルバムが ""ゴーバック ""アルバムであることを認めざるを得ない。  チープ・トリックは80年代にリリースしたほとんどの作品で音楽界に火をつけることはなかったが、信じられないほど劣悪なリリース『&quot;The Doctor&quot;』で腐敗が始まるまでは、彼らのアルバムについて何か良いことを言わなければならないと、積極的に探していたのだった。  quot;TheDoctor&quot;では、探したが空振りだった。 &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot;はそこまでひどくはないが、この後のリリースに悪い流れを作ることになった。  私は何年もかけて何十枚ものチープ・トリックのコンピレーションを作ったが、LOLから収録した曲は&quot;Let Go&quot;だけだった。  80年代から90年代初頭にかけてのリリースで一貫して私をいらだたせたのは、このアルバムがトリックを彼らのロッキンのルーツに戻したというプレスリリースだったんだ。  しかし、これはそれとは程遠いものだった。  そうですね。  私は覚えている。"
5,ダン・ゼーンズは最高です！20ヶ月の子供だけでなく、夫も私もこれを楽しんで聴いています。息子用に持っている他の音楽CDのほとんどは、少し聴くとイライラしてしまうんです。Rocket Ship Beachは楽しくて家族で楽しめる音楽です！すべての年齢の方にお勧めします。
1,うわあああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああああこれは恐ろしいアルバムだ。Comin' From Where I'm Fromがとても良かったので、ここぞとばかりに良いものを期待したのですが。間違っている。タイトル曲のアンソニー・ハミルトンは、潜在的にポジティブな社会科学的歌詞で登場し、その後、祈りについて話し始める。もちろん、神話にこだわるカルト宗教の人たちは心配などしておらず、神話的な魔法使いが空からやってきて、ひざまづいていればすべてを解決してくれると考えている。その後の4曲は完全にジーザスソングである。人々は何らかの理由で不快と判断したアルバムに警告ラベルを求めるが、カルトの警告のようなものが必要なのだ。私は、このCDがカルトのゴタゴタに乗っかっていると知っていたら、購入しなかっただろう。Preacher's Daughter」では、「A preacher's daugher so she had common sense」とまで言っている。ジョークなのかどうかはわからないが、常識的に考えて、魔法使いは雲の上に住んでいるわけではないことがわかるはずだ。そして「Pass Me Over」は、アイス・キューブの「Lethal Injection」の2部構成のスキットで、猫がただ座ってイエスを待ち、アイス・キューブに自分のものをすべて与えるという場面を思い出させる。しかし、アンソニー・ハミルトンは、神話が現実になるのをただ座って待つことをポジティブなことのように伝えようとしています。もし、このような行動が個人的な問題や世界の問題に対する真の解決策だと考えているのなら、私は、私たちの未来がとても心配になります。それは非常に危険な精神状態です。「Sista Big Bones」は良い曲だが、これを買う価値はない。
4,Ab Fabのバブルは、マリリン・モンロー、ビリー・ホリデイ、ジュディ・ガーランドなどにそっくりな音です。  なんて才能なんだ。  彼女には自分のラスベガスショーが必要だ。  彼女は素晴らしい存在になるだろう！  
5,このアルバムについては、前作との比較という意味で、肯定的な評価と否定的な評価が多いようです。正直なところ、私はこのアルバムを3回聴くまで、バンドの人事異動を知りませんでした。Evanescenceは本物です。楽しんでください！5つ星です。
5,私はBeckのことをよく知らなかった一人です。  Loser」、「Where It's At」、「The New Pollution」など、彼のヒット曲は知っていましたが、彼について深く考えたことはありませんでした。  3ヶ月ほど前、Napster2Goでこのアルバムから2曲ほどダウンロードするまでは......「E Pro」と「Girl」だ。  何度か聴いてみて、その後すぐにGueroの全アルバムをダウンロードしました。  このアルバムが2005年のベストアルバムに選ばれたのには理由があるんだ。  これは素晴らしいアルバムです。  長いドライブ中に、ベターハーフに何曲か聴かせたら、だんだん病みつきになった。  今ではこのアルバムだけでなく、私たち2人にとってのBeckのカタログはほとんど全てです :)最初は「うーん」と思っていた曲も、だんだん好きになってきました。  音楽性は完璧だし、BECKは間違いなく健康的な皮肉が混じった強いユーモアのセンスを持っている！  E-Pro（アルバムのキックスタートが素晴らしい）、Que Onda' Guero（ローライダーのホーン、そして「ヘイ！ゲロ！」というランダムなシャウトが最高）、Girl（キャッチー。これは大ヒットするはずだった...）、Earthquake Weather（心に響くメロディー、素晴らしいリフ！）、Hell Yes（ハイ！）、そして私はRental Carが本当に好きです...ちょうどかわいい小さな曲で、短すぎます...リフと詩もキャッチーです！  このアルバムをぜひチェックしてみてください。  まさに逸品
5,このアーティストは明らかに過去のカントリーミュージシャンを参考にしているので、「アルトカントリー」という表現は確かに限定的だが、正確な参照点である。しかし、間違いなく、これは同じような古い同じようなものを繰り返すような退屈なものではなく、むしろ例外的な現代音楽である。私は通常、ツンギーよりもヘビーの方に傾くのだが、これはとてもよく書かれていてキャッチーで独特のメランコリックな雲がかかっており、この女性は歌うこともできる。この指定にふさわしい最近のミュージシャン数名のひとりである
5,"David Rawlingsプロデュースの「O.C.M.S.」が私の音楽コレクションに大きな影響を与えた後、「Big Iron World」の予約はかなり大きな期待をもって行われました。Wagon Wheel」のような即効性のある曲はないものの、「Big Iron World」は素晴らしく意外性のあるパンチを効かせています。OCMSのライブ・アクトを最大限に捉えてはいないが（そして、誰がそんなことをできるだろうか）、ローリングスのプロダクションは再びOCMSの信頼性を維持し、他のネオ・ブルーグラスのレコードに見られるような無粋でオーバープロダクションで人工的なギミックは全くなく、彼らの「オールドタイム」音楽を現代のエリアに押し出すことに成功した。   「Big Iron World ""は、歴史に囚われたり、過去の偉業に噛み付こうとするアルバムではありません。OCMSは ""Big Iron World ""で再び独自のサウンドを示し、ブルーグラス/カントリー/ロック/パンク/フォークの限界を押し広げながら、ウディ・ガスリーの寓話、ミュールスキナーのピッキング、ディランの60年代後半のアルバムに敬意を払い振り返った。さらに、『ビッグ・アイアン・ワールド』の曲は、完全な作品群を構成している。プロユニオンの「Union Maid」とフォーク調の「James River Blues」は、各曲が次の曲を引き立て、アルバム全体として機能している際立った曲である。OCMSのすべてのアルバムと同様に、『Big Iron World』は、同じような年齢のアーティストが出した他のほとんどのアルバムと比較して、新鮮な空気を感じさせるものだ。  彼らは、様々なジャンルのファンが楽しめる素晴らしい曲のコレクションを作り上げたのである。"
5,家に1枚、車に1枚、そしてもう1枚は、彼のコンサートでサインしてもらったものです！1997年末にテレビのトークショーに出演して以来、彼のファンです...日々の多忙なスケジュールにもかかわらず、彼の音楽はいつも私たちを穏やかでリラックスした平和な場所に戻してくれます...今では小さな子供がいるので、彼らは彼の音楽を聞くことに慣れていて、就寝時間がさらに甘くなりますね！:)
1,"冗談でしょう？このアルバムに5つ星をつけている人たちがいるんだ。みんな盲目すぎて笑えないよ。これはすべて商業化されたゴミだ。E-40は今、この ""hyphy ""チップに夢中なんだ。Hyphyはストレートにワックだし、歌詞には何のコンセプトもない。すべて無意味です。  プロダクションは、そうだな、このアルバムのように、商業化されたアルバムはすべてプロダクションがある。しかし、それにしても歌詞はどこにあるのだろう？   このアルバムは、ビートとフックのためだけに座って好きになるようなアルバムの1つだ(笑)。このタイプの音楽を聴く人は本当のヒップホップが好きではない、言ったように彼らは盲目だ。ヒップホップのファンでない人たちは、あなたが聴くことを批判しませんが、ヒップホップのファンを名乗る人たちは、ここから出て行ってください、あなたはそうではありません。   このアルバムは商業的なラップを聴く人だけのもので、アンダーグラウンドが好きな人は絶対に近づかないように。代わりに本物のHipHopを手に入れよう。  ピース。"
2,最初にこのCDを買ったときはとても気に入っていたのですが、他のCDと違って、時間が経つにつれて音が悪くなっていきました。2-3ヶ月後には引き出しの中で眠っていて、ラジオでKillersが流れると局を飛ばしてしまうようになっていました。今週末のヴァージン・フェスティバルで彼らのライブを見た後、彼らは完全にインチキだとわかった。自分自身のために、このCDを買うお金を節約してください。
5,"大音量のコンサートの後、長い夜道を帰宅するとき、私は静かで落ち着くものを聴きたいのです。  THE PIZZA TAPESは、私のお気に入りの静かで落ち着く曲のひとつで、アコースティックなジャミングとインスピレーションに満ちた演奏の甘い傑作です。  1993年2月の2日間、ガルシア、グリスマン、ライスの3人が集まって、いくつかの曲をいじりながらテープに録音し、その出来栄えを確認しました。  周知のように、この録音は悪名高い ""ピザボーイ ""によって盗まれ、すぐにグレイトフル・デッドのテープやCDの取引コミュニティの所有物となった。  数年後、グリスマンはその音源をリマスタリングし、ベストテイクをこのアルバムに収録した。  このアルバムはエレクトリック・ジャムのアルバムではなく、むしろ即興的で、静かで、気楽なものである。  人によっては ""BGM ""として片付けてしまうかもしれない。  しかし、よく聴いてみると、トリオは伝統的な曲、ボブ・ディランの曲、ガーシュイン（！）の曲などをとても巧みに扱っていて、インスピレーションに欠ける音や間違った音を見つけることはほとんどない。  ガルシアはあちこちで失敗しているが、その失敗さえも聴きものにしている。  間違いなく名盤であり、私は期待して受け取ったものです。  今でもこれをかけると楽しいし、何度も聴くうちにもっと良くなる。  ところで、私はこのジャケットアートが大好きです...CDケースはピザの箱を模して作られています。  CDケースを開けると、ディスクはピザパイで、すべてのトッピングが載っている。  裏面にはスパイシーなメニューも載っていて、アルバムを聴いているとピザが食べたくなるんです。  PIZZA TAPESは、確かにおいしいアルバムだ。素晴らしい音楽と素晴らしいピザ、最高の組み合わせだ！"
2,"リック・ニールセン「テル・ミー・エヴリシング」です！なぜテッド・テンプルマンのような残念なプロデューサーに、素晴らしいカムバックLPになるはずだったものをプロデュースさせたんだ？もし、トリック・ファンが ""マイ・ギャング ""になりたいのなら、トリックスターが雇用され続けるためには、これよりも良い結果を得られるように、このニュースを広めて祈らなければならない！  You're All I Wanna Do」とタイトル曲の「Mommy and Daddy」コーラスは、「Surrender」にしてはちょっとクールでレトロな感じだ-今、結婚生活は破綻している！この恥さらしの後のチープ・トリックのカリアゲのように！泣く子も黙る...ブラント復活してくれ！"
1,私はこのディスクをアマゾンのここのレビューの強さで購入しました。  このディスクはなんと大きな失望を与えたことでしょう。  キーボードのループドラムやキーボードのベースなど、恥ずかしくなるほどアマチュアで、これが有名なプロのレゲエシンガーであるとは到底思えません。  また、子供向けの音楽は、子供たちが音楽に夢中になるために必要なものではありません（例えば、優れたPutamayoシリーズは、飾り気もなく、ダブることもありません）。  良いquot;子供向け音楽は、親と子供の両方を刺激し、子供は親のそれにポジティブに反応します。このディスクに$...を支払うのは残念だ。
5,"ルペ・フィアスコのデビュー・アルバム『フード・アンド・リカー』を購入したのは、このアルバムがきっかけだった。このアルバムを最初から最後まで聴いた後、私は全く失望しませんでした。しかし、このアルバムは、車、服、宝石、女性以外のことについてラップしない他のMCを聞く代わりに、日常生活で扱う問題について韻を踏んでいるラッパーがまだ何人かいることを私に教えてくれたのです。このアルバムは、人生の多くのことに目を開かせてくれるから、本物のラップのファンなら誰にでも勧められるよ。  僕の好きな曲は5曲です：1. ""The Cool""-この曲は基本的に、死んでしまった（文字通りではない）若者のことを歌っているのだが、彼は生き返ることができ、より良い方向に変化しようとしたが、同時に彼は以前と同じように生きることを選んだ。この曲は、とてもメタファーで深い曲です。2. ""he say she say""-この曲は、父親が見えない小さな男の子について歌っていて、それが彼に深く影響している。3. ""hurt me soul""-この曲は、ラップミュージックで貶められる女性、麻薬取引、不正な警官、黒人に福祉を提供しない政府、医療費の過剰請求、売春婦など、思いつく限りの問題を語っています。この曲は、フックもとてもいい。4. ""sunshine""-この曲は、彼がクラブで恋に落ちた女の子について歌っているのですが、彼は愛を探しているわけではないのですが、この女の子には我慢できないのです。5. ""pressure"" featuring jay-z - ルペの立場からするととてもいいコンセプトの曲で、ジェイ・ズの大ファンではないのですが、彼はいいヴァースをしていますね。  他の曲では、""Just might be ok"", ""daydreaminin"", ""kick push"", ""i gotcha"", ""instrumental"", ""american terrorists ""が好きです。  このアルバムは、本当のラップのファンであれば、誰にでもお勧めできる！"
5,"この作品は高く評価できない。確かに前作と同じ系統の作品ですが、よく指摘されているように、より政治的で社会批判に満ちた作品です。その結果、前2作より少し劣るという人もいるでしょう。私もそのような反応を予想していましたが、結局のところ、社会派的な要素には意外なほど説得力があり、ロドニーはそれを個人的な洞察とうまく融合させ、最終的にはそれが優位に立つことになりました。また、社会的なコメントに焦点を当てると、これらの曲の多くが、Notorious Cherry Bombsと一緒に作った素晴らしい作品の、少し怒った、より内省的なバージョンのような、ただ楽しい曲だという事実が見えなくなってしまうことがあります。  ところで、このアルバムが気に入ったら、「Rednecks & Bluenecks」という本を手に取ってみてはいかがでしょうか：The Politics of Country Music ""という本があります。ラジオで聴くカントリーだけでなく、オルタナティブ・カントリーやアメリカーナについても書かれているんだ。この本ではロドニーが大きく取り上げられていて、このアルバムについてのセクションもあります。"
1,"去年のBillboard Hot 100を毎週のように見ていたのですが、ある時、動いている曲がPretty Rickyの「Grind With Me」であることに気がつきました。私はこの曲を聴いたことがなかったのですが、聴いた後、やはりこの曲を聴かなかったらよかったと思いました。何がきっかけでフルアルバム『Bluestars』を聴くことになったのかわかりませんが、聴いてみたら、まあ、すぐにステレオからCDを取り出せなくなりましたね。  レビュアーのハキームが、「この5つ星のレビューはすべて、グループのストリートチームか何かに所属している人たちによるものだろう」と言ったことに、私は同意する。プリティ・リッキーは、3人のラッパー（スペクタキュラー、ダイアモンド・""ベイビー・ブルー""、スリック--ラッパーという言葉は緩く使っている）と1人のシンガー（プレジャー）の4人で構成されています。このアルバムの問題は、私がこれまで耳にしたことのないような、最もエロくて最も才能のない男たちであることで、これはひどい組み合わせだ。リードシングルの「Grind With Me」は本当は「Grind On Me」と呼ばれ、私が今まで聞いた中で最も厄介なものの一つだが、「Playhouse」もそれに遠く及ばない。そして ""Nothing But a Number ""は非常に、非常に法定されています。  また、「Grind On Me」の「If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right」や「Grill `Em」の「If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'」（そもそもこの意味は？）のように、時代がかった歌詞を使っているのも気になる。また、「Get a Little Closer」では「FROM THE BACK！」、「Your Body」では「Yes, sir！」など、特定のアドリブを叫び続ける癖がある。また、Pleasureの歌はHORRIBLEではないものの、あれだけワチャワチャしたラップの後に聴くのは辛いです。実際、""Shorty Be Mine ""での彼のコーラスは、あなたにDISpleasureを引き起こすこと間違いなしです。  この曲といえば、「Never Let You Go」「Can't Live Without You」、そしてお決まりのブリンブリン曲「Chevy」「Grill `Em」のように、男たちがセックスについて語らないときも同様に印象が悪いです。でも、長い目で見れば、もう誰もプリティ・リッキーなんて気にしないし、弟が言ったように、彼らはウェンディーズで働くようになったんだろうから、そんなことはどうでもいいことなんだろうけど。もしまたBluestarsのCDに出会ったら、""Your Body ""の言葉を借りれば、ボコボコにしてやろう。  アンソニー・ルーパー"
5,わぁ...なんて素晴らしい曲の集まりなんだ、素晴らしいアルバムだ。私はチャーチのファンですが、たとえ彼らのことを聞いたことがなくても、このディスクの素晴らしさに気づくでしょう。私は曲を説明する言葉を失うほどです。唯一の残念なことは、これらの曲の演奏のDVDがないことです。私は2階に上がって一晩中見ていたいと思います。
5,本当によくできている。これは非常によくできたCDです。Six Daysはここに収録されている曲の中で一番いい曲だろう。  注：bow wowの車を待っている時の曲はOoh Aah - Gritです。
2,車のCDプレーヤーで再生できなかったので、自宅のDVDプレーヤーで聴くしかない。
1,このCDを聴き、amazonでJohn Fogertyのlong road homeのdvdも観ました。彼の演奏するギターや楽器は、偉大な才能を持つ伝説を見るのに最高です。彼の声はとても素晴らしく、クリアです。私たちは皆、あの時の歴史に引き戻されました。彼らは皆、amazonでPremonitionを買いました。私は、このDVDが輸入品であることを知っています。私のものは、音声も画像も素晴らしく、まるでジョンが演奏している観客席に座っているような気分になります。それ以外のものは、努力の結果、星1つだ。でも、僕が持っているJohn FogertyのPremonitionのCollector's Edition dvdには及ばないけどね。
2,Amazon.comでショパン・ソナタのいくつかの抜粋を聴いただけで、「あとは聴きたくない」ということがはっきりしました。たとえば、スケルツォ（第2楽章）を例にとろう。ラン・ランは、中間部のエピソードを「少し遅い」どころか、少なくとも2倍は遅く弾いています。ショパン（作曲者！）はテンポの変更を要求しておらず、モルト・ヴィヴァーチェをキャンセルしていないのです。残念なことに、演奏者があちこちに手を加えることで、作曲家のコードを注意深く読み、理解し、意味を理解しようとするのではなく、いわゆるオリジナルで「深い」演奏になることが非常に多いのです。私はショパンの天才を信頼し、既存の美の上に自分のエゴを置くような人は決していません。     
2,これをアルバムと呼べる人がいるのかわからない。これはミックステープなんだ。リル・ウェインは基本的にアルバム全体を通してフリースタイルをしている！ビートは淡白で、ウェインのフリースタイルでタイトなのは数曲だけだ。目立ったフリースタイル：THE MOBB、MONEY ON MY MIND、FIREMAN、OH NO、HIT EM'UP、IM A DBOY。ロックンロードは退屈なトラックで、クルプトはフックで囁いてる（WTF！）。彼が北のファン層にこの作品を買わせようとしていたのは明らかだ。彼に5つ星をつけたレビュアーの大半は北の方から来ている。Lil WayneのベストアルバムはLIGHTS OUTとTHE CARTERです。Lil Wayneの最悪なアルバム：THE BLOCK IS HOT、500 DEGREES、THE CARTER 2。
2,"私は普段、amazonで否定的なレビューは書かないことにしているのですが、それは大抵、否定的なフィードバック/不親切な投票などしか得られないからです。というのも、通常、amazonのレビューは否定的なものばかりだからです。だから、できるだけ公平に書こうと思います。レナード・コーエンのコンピレーション「i'm your man」を手に入れたんだけど、アントニーがやっている「if it be your will」のすごいすごい演奏があるんだ。このレコードの中で一番好きな曲だったし、レナード・コーエンのトリビュート・コンサート全般の中で、「come so far for beauty」は本当にいい曲だよ。「If It be your will ""は、とてもソウルフルな声で演奏され、バックボーカルが泣きながら、彼がタイトルの言葉を何度も繰り返しながら、最後まで自己を高めていくところがとても気に入りました。そこで私は図書館に行き、アントニーのこのデビュー作を借りるために1ヶ月待ちました。そう、それは同じ声だったのだ。そう、アントニーの声はとても興味深く、どこか美しい。このアルバムのスリーブを見て、私は最初尻込みしてしまいました（そして、その後もそうでした）。私は、音楽をそのカバーアートと一緒に並べることが多い人間だ（例えば、あの完璧な23封筒スリーブを持つThis Mortal Coilの「song to the siren」をチェックしてみよう）。だから、このアルバムを何度か聴いたが、実際にニヤニヤしたり、ゾッとしたりするような愚かな歌詞に気後れしてしまった。""ミスター・マッスル ""が ""ケチケチ ""な小物を私に押し付ける......」とか、「私はとても幸せです、だから私を殴ってください」とか「悲しみの川、飲み込まないで」とか、「黄昏」という言葉の息苦しい言い方とか、わからないけど、ちょっと不快になったんだよ。だから、僕はこのレコードが好きじゃなかったみたいだ。   その後、INTERVIEW誌でエルトン・ジョンが2005年の新しい音楽について語った記事を読んだら、アントニーの2枚目のレコードを絶賛していたんだ。それでもう一度試してみたんだけど、3曲でもう手に負えなくなった。このCDのイメージや、彼が歌っていること、あるいは言葉の表現が、それを台無しにしている。レナード・コーエンのような詩人の歌を歌えば、もっと良くなるのでは？エルトン・ジョンの記事で、アントニーはセクシュアリティについてたくさん歌っていると言っていて、それは歌詞から読み取れるのですが、彼は自分のセクシュアリティを、「もしあなたが私のことを嫌いなら、あるいは私が提示するこの悲しい人生に惹かれないなら、それはあなたがゲイやトランスジェンダーの人々を嫌いだからだ」と言わんばかりの情けない形で提示します。私の場合、それは真実から遠く離れたことではありません。私はこのレコードを誰にも勧めませんが、人にこのレコードを紹介するとき、私は「If it be your will」がどれほど好きだったか、彼のソロ作品にどれほど失望したかを語らずにはいられないのです。"
2,私に言わせれば、前作と同じようなサウンドだ。  バンド、アレンジ、ミキシングはいつも素晴らしいが、ボブはまだ自然災害、古い車、ダストボール、アニー、フラニー、サラ、ルース、その他思いつく限りの古い時代のナンセンスな絵を描こうとしているんだ。  彼に神のご加護を
1,サバタはLPの性能に合わせてオペラを急がせ、マリアは常に叫び、ピアニッシミはなく、全員がアルバムに合わせて時間内に録音を終わらせなければならないような超ハイテンションだったのである。  最高のトスカはマリア・カラスとプレートル録音です。  このモノラル録音は買ってはいけない。  マリアはこの時、トスカが誰であるかを理解していなかった。
2,今まで聞いた中で最も笑えないほどひどいバンド名であることはさておき、この人たちは本当に私のためにならないんだ。  多くの音楽はかなりまともだが、シンガーが信じられないほど迷惑だ。  私はボーカルの完璧さにこだわりがあるわけではないが、この男は本当にひどいと思う。  カラオケバーで酔っ払いの歌を聴いた方がマシだった。    でも、さっきも言ったように、バンド全体が完全にひどいというわけではないんだ。  彼らはまともなミュージシャンだし、多くの音楽が好きなんだけど、あのボーカルだけはどうしても好きになれないんだ。  通常、バンドを名前で判断するのは良い考えではありませんが、うーん...今回はそのような時ではありません。
1,ルシンダは大きな期待を抱かせるので、ちょっと不公平かもしれませんが、このレコードには本当にがっかりしました。ソングライティングは弱く、歌は弱く、アレンジは鈍く、何かが音楽の生命を追い出しています。曲は全部同じではありませんが、なぜか全部同じに聞こえます。恥ずかしいことに、一度聴いたらほとんどの曲を歌えます。
5,私はアモス・リーのこの新しいCDが大好きです。    最初のシングルは『Shout Out Loud』というタイトルです。  この曲は本当にいい気分にさせてくれる。  彼のギタープレイは、ここではとてもエネルギッシュだ。  でも、私のお気に入りの曲はLong Line Of Painです。  個人的な喪失感と孤独を歌った美しい曲だ。Sympathizeは、このディスクのもう一つのハイライトです。  エイモス・リーの繊細な歌声は、運に見放された人々への思いやりに満ちている。  Southern Girlは、エイモスが南部出身の女の子の魅力に敬意を表した曲です。  Night Trainは、とてもきれいなラブソングです。Skipping Stoneは、愛する人を失った後、前に進もうとするブルージーなサウンドの曲です。  Freedomは面白い曲です。  自由の追求が暴力に繋がってはいけないということを思い出させてくれる。  この曲の歌詞は真実であり、示唆に富んでいる。Sweet Peaは、特別な人のもとに帰ってくることを歌ったシンプルで甘い曲です。  Carelessは、友人の裏切りについて歌った素晴らしい曲です。  この曲でのエイモスの声の喪失感や傷ついた感じが好きです。   Supply and Demandは、才能ある若いミュージシャンとソングライターによる、とても楽しいCDです。
2,このCDはレビューを見て買ったのですが、歌が受け付けないです。  小さい子供が歌っているのが多すぎるし、大人もダメ。  あまりにギミックが多すぎる。  伝統的な曲をきれいに歌いたいのであれば、このセットは必要ないでしょう！  私は好きな曲をコピーして自分のCDを作ろうと思っています。私が使うのは1枚のCDに2曲くらいだと思います！  悪い点
5,オードラ・マクドナルドは、ストレイサンド以来、最高のミュージカル・シアター・シンガーであることを再び証明した。彼女の選曲（ほとんどがロックやポップスのカバー）には多くのファンが異論を唱えるかもしれないが、彼女の声とその解釈は他の追随を許さないものである。
2,私はこの兄弟の作品の大ファンだが、このアルバムは真面目なビージーズ・コレクターに対する侮辱だと思う。  ここに収録されている曲は、レアでもなく、新曲でもなく、入手不可能でもない。  バリー＆ロビンは、コンピレーションのパクリではなく、自分たちのファンたちにご褒美を与えるために復帰する時が来たのだ。  ロビンの最新作「A Live CD」だって、また古い曲ばかり......私は古い曲より新しい曲に飢えているんだ。  そして、誤解しないでほしいのですが、モーリスが亡くなったとき、私の心は傷つき、私の世界は止まってしまいました。  30年来のファンである私は、彼らの音楽を初期から愛してきたし、これからもずっとそうしていくつもりだ...だが、どうか兄弟から新しい曲が必要だ。  だからバリーはロビンと一緒になって、まだ持っている素晴らしい作曲の才能を私たちに見せてくれ。  熱心なリスナーのお守り、ダンディー
1,Black Eyed Peasはラップ史上最悪のグループだ！Black Eyed Peasより悪い音楽を作ることができる人がいるとは信じがたい。このグループは、ラップ、ヒップホップ、R&B、その他あらゆるタイプの音楽にとって、これまでに作られた音楽の恥ずべき存在だ。ラップ界の不合格者であるこのダサくて極端に才能のない人たちを、どうして、どうして支持し続けるのか、まったく信じられない。前作のCDはゴミだと思ったが、今回のCDはElephunkが設定した低いマークを信じられないほど超えている。「おい、売り払おうぜ、今まで知られている中で最悪の音楽を作ろうとするんだ」とでも言うべきものだった。唯一の良いニュースは、彼らが音楽家としてのキャリアを潰したのですぐに忘れ去られ、生き残るためにコマーシャル用のジングルに頼らざるを得ないということだ。この3人のオリジナリティのない、才能のない、つまらない、迷惑な、売れ残りの、偽物のやり手たちは、どんな種類の音楽も作るのをやめて、音楽ビジネスから完全に手を引くべきだね。今夜は、この音楽業界の愚か者たちが二度と曲を作らないよう、一生懸命に祈ることにしよう！！！彼らは最低だと言うのは褒め言葉だ。彼らは今後1000年間、常に練習し続けなければならないし、最低と言えるほどの才能をかき集めるために悪魔と契約しなければならないだろう！彼らは本当に最低なんだ!
1,"ジェイミー・フォックスといえば、平凡な俳優として有名かもしれない（『Ray』での演技は一度だけ良かったが）。  しかし今、彼は平凡なシンガー／ライターとして最もよく知られている。  彼の声は良いのだが、陳腐であったり、フックがなかったりする。  基本的に中身はないのだが、映画「Ray」の後、資本参加できると思っているのだろう。  そして、彼が良い曲を書くことができると言う人には、曲を見て、彼の素晴らしい詩的な歌詞を見てみましょう：   Yo you sleep Naw I just um, I think I want some more Yea I know we just got through But its just so good, I just caint help it tho' Its something about your body Naw it aint all I think about Well to be honest, oh Im startingin' to believe、  毎日、毎晩、毎時間、毎分、そのことばかり考えていて、仕事でも、車でも、教会でも、祈ろうとしても、うまくいかない：] (Sex) All the time (Sex) On my mind (Sex) Everywhere I go (Sex) I'm tryna let you know (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love S-E-X ohhheee (Sex) Can make you crazy (Sex) Can make a baby (Sex) All night long (Sex) It's the perfect song (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love S-E-X oh It getting to the point to me (where I) DVD買うとテレビ観ます 新作399 (39. 999 for the new releases)99 for the new releases) I aint proud of it, because it's getting in the way of love for me And I caint help it, caint shake it (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me [Chorus：(Sex)ずっと (Sex) On my mind (Sex) Everywhere I go (Sex) I'm tryna let you know (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love S-E-X ohhheee (Sex) Can make you crazy (Sex) Can make a baby (Sex) All night long (Sex) It's the perfect song (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love S-E-X oh Some call it bad、Some call it good Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood I do it hood (Can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh Some like it slow, some like it fast It long as it lasts I make it last (Can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh - Wow, that is a big pile of trash！  こんな歌詞なら、グラミー賞も余裕で獲れるはずだ。  その調子だ、ジェイミー！"
2,このCDには3、4曲の良い曲があります。もしあなたが、自分の子供たちのためにコンピレーションを作るために購入したいのなら、彼らはそのうちのいくつかを気に入るでしょう。他の曲は、子供たちが興奮するには遅くて退屈です。子供向けのCDでは全く意味をなさないものがいくつかある。子供を眠らせるCDを作るか、それとも元気づけるCDを作るか決めかねて、1枚のCDで両方をやってしまったようです。これでは、私の子供には使えません。ジョン・リスゴー「Singin in the Bathtub」の方がずっと良い選択です。歌は陽気で生き生きしています。私の子供たちはいつもこのCDを欲しがります。
5,他のAntony's Musicと同様に、このEPも冷ややかで超人的なクオリティを持っている。彼の他の作品とは異なり、アルバム以外の曲（「The Lake」と「The Horror Is Gone」）ではプロダクションがトーンダウンされ、私にとってはAntony & The Johnsonsの核心を定義する、荒涼とした白面の美しさとなっている。アルバム収録曲の「Fistful of Love」は、私の好きなアントニーの曲のひとつで、ソウルフルでグルーヴ感のあるラメントで、マゾヒズムが高揚感と救いのあるフェチであることを説得的に主張している。  値段は少し高いが、アントニーファンのライブラリーに加えるには最適な1枚だ。
4,私はCLAY-MATEではありません...しかし、Clay AikenはAIのどのシーズンでも間違いなく最高の準優勝者です。  とはいえ...このCDを気に入るかどうか、まだ確信が持てませんでした。  そして、最初はそうではなかった。  でも、何度か聴いているうちに、ほとんどの曲が好きになってきたんです。  全部ではないので、5つ星にはしませんでしたが、とても良いアルバムです。  私のお気に入りは、たまたまタイトル曲です。  でも、このCDには他にもいい曲がいくつもあります。  このスタイルの音楽が好きかどうかは別として、クレイ・エイケンが最高の男声の持ち主であることには異論はないだろう。  おそらく、彼の年齢で最高の男性の声だ。  このCDはアダルト・コンテンポラリーに興味がある人なら誰でも薦められる。  もちろん、もしあなたがクレイ・エイケンのファンなら、何も言う必要はないだろう：
1,"ポスタルサービスの大ファンである私は（彼らの「Give Up」は私のアルバムトップ10に簡単に入る）、ジミー・タンベレロがポスタルサービスの片割れであることから、このDntelのアルバムに大きな期待をしていました。大きな間違いです。サンプルを聴いてみて、気に入ったものがあれば購入し、気に入らないものがあれば、30秒を超えると曲が良くなると思うような私の勘違いはしないでください。このCDの中で価値のある曲：1)""（これは）エヴァンとチャンの夢""（ポスタルサービスのリミックスはiTunesで入手でき、CDに収録されているものより良いバージョンです）デス・キャブとポスタルサービスのベン・ギバードが歌っているもの。2) ""Last Songs ""は、どちらかというと、リラックスできる。この2曲はiTunesで手に入れて、そのままにしておくのがおすすめです。  CDはまともな2曲のために高すぎる。  ジミー・タンベレロはFigurineとJames Figurineという別のデジタルプロジェクトを持っていて、それはDntelのもっとキャッチーでポップなバージョンで、よりPostal Serviceに近い。"
4,これはポール・サイモンのアルバムの中でもかなり異質なサウンドである。  ブライアン・イーノからの影響は明らかで、時に大げさなほどです。  このアルバムを持ってしばらく経った今、私の結論は、常に聴くようなアルバムではないが、気が向いたときには本当に面白く楽しいアルバムだということだ。  時折、ポールが『グレースランド』以来到達したとは思えない高みに到達することもある。  このアルバムには素晴らしい曲もいくつかある。  Still Crazy after all these years」や「50 Ways to Leave Your Lover」のような曲をお探しなら、ここにはないでしょう。  しかし、ポールが限界に挑戦するのを聴きたいのであれば、この曲は最適だ。  ポールはこの曲で、失敗するよりも的中させることの方が多い。
1,私は、アーティストが持つ実験的な精神にいつも感心しています。ビジュアルアーティストとして、私は常に新しいことに挑戦しています。たまに、「1週間後に見て、どう感じるか」というテストに耐えられるような新しい要素やコンセプトに出会うことがあるのです。しかし、その一方で、世の中の人が見向きもしないようなジャンクな作品を作ってしまうこともある。アニマル・コレクティヴは、このしばしば愚かで無意味なサウンドのコレクションをリリースすることを再考すべきだった。これは失敗した芸術的実験なのだ。このディスク（私が聴いた唯一のAC）だけがそうであることを願う。というのも、誰かがいつまでも芸術的な駄作をコンスタントに発表し続け、それでもまだ逃げ続けているのは恥ずべきことだからだ。
2,私は、初心者の音楽教室のドアを誰かが開け閉めしている間に、ほとんど幼稚園の子供たちが猫のことを叫んでいるアルバムを作曲し、それを芸術と呼ぶことにしたのです。  人々はこの音楽について多くのレビューを書き、素晴らしい、年齢の知恵を保ちながら若者の本質を捉えていると言うだろう。  彼らは、「臭い」と言うのを恐れて、このようなことをするのです。  音楽は耳を痛めるようなものではありません。  これを良い音楽と呼ぶのは、優れた音楽家に対する侮辱である。    このアルバムを作曲したとき、彼らは明らかに凧よりも、いや、気象観測用の風船よりも高いところにいたのだから。  創造的、かもしれない。  聴き応え、楽しさ、ユーモア、会社が終わってからも遊べるような、そんな作品ではない。
1,まず最初に、私はアンドリュー・ロイド・ウェバーの大ファンではないということをお話しします。  彼の作品の中には、『ジョセフ』や各ミュージカルからの様々な曲のように素晴らしいものもありますが、全体的には、彼はほとんどのショーに非常に偽りのサウンドのポップオペラを取り入れようとしています。  残念ながら、ゴシック・オペラに初めて挑戦した『白衣の女』はさらにひどいものだった。ウェバーは明らかに、不協和音のコードや大音量のオーケストラを詰め込むことで、このミュージカルのスコアが質の高い、示唆に富んだ作品であるかのように装おうとしたが、それは彼が音楽について本当に何も知らないことを示すだけだ。  ショーのスコアの半分は、何のつながりもないようなランダムな音符で構成されています（まるでソンドハイムの天才を模倣しようとしたかのようです）。  曲は淡泊で、本は退屈で混乱し、多くの演技は下手くそである。  例えば、「白衣の女」を演じた女優は、CDの全編を通してただ悲鳴をあげている。  歌っているときでさえも、その叫び声は耳に痛い。  まるで、自分のキャラクターの未熟さを騒音でカバーすることにしたかのようだ。  他の役者もそれなりなのだが、あまりに役不足なので、描写が退屈に感じられる。確かに、クロフォードのフォスコ伯爵の素晴らしい演技（特にYou Can Get Away With Anythingのライブバージョンは素晴らしい！）など、このCDのハイライトもあるのだが、全体として、このCDを受け入れるのは難しい。  いくつかの曲は非常に美しいのに、それらが辞任したトラックも、悲鳴や退屈な台詞、大音量の音楽でいっぱいです。  ミュージカルのライブ盤CDで、1曲だけ観客のリアクションがあるのは、失敗の予兆だと思う。
1,キャッツ」はダメだと思ってたんだ。これは、私の耳を汚した不幸な出来事として、最も退屈で、愚かで、無意味で、全くひどい音楽のゴミのような作品です。ストーリーラインもなく、音楽の幅もなく、感情もなく、ひどい音楽を裏付ける歌詞もない。つまり、リストは永遠に続くのだ。警告しておきますが、これはあなたが使うかもしれない、いや、これから使うかもしれない25ドルの最大の無駄遣いです。お願いです、自分のために、そして私を信じてください。このCDは買わないでください！もし買ったとしても、それを聴けば、私が何を言っているのかよくわかるはずです。さあ、あなたの稼いだお金を、人生の目的があるものに使ってください。
5,このアルバムが好きなら、タイトル曲が好きなら、バンド名と特にタイトル曲の元ネタが、西部劇の傑作「バッド・カンパニー」（1972年）であることを知れば、一部のハードコアなファンも刺激されるかもしれませんね。  ピアノのインストゥルメンタルは、「ファンタスティックス」のハーヴェイ・シュミットが手がけたこの映画のサウンドトラックから引用されたものです。  この曲は、映画そのものを見るまでは、ちょっと謎だったのですが、とても心に響く曲です。  主演はバリー・ブラウンとジェフ・ブリッジス。  この曲は、あらゆる想像力を持つ西部劇ファンだけでなく、バンド自体のファンにとっても価値があり、私にとってそうであったように、この曲をより意味のあるものにする手助けをしてくれるでしょう  どちらもおすすめです
5,"エルトン・ジョンに関しては、私の客観性はあまり高くないと認識しているので、オンラインレビューをするのを控えていました。  私は彼のやることすべてが大好きです（「Victim of Love」さえも！）。  でも、もう我慢できませんでした。  このCDは素晴らしい。  エルトン・ジョンとバーニー・トーピンは、世代を超え、溝を埋め、さらには長年にわたる個人的・芸術的な過ちに敬意を表する作品を作り上げました。  この作品は、2人の天才が約37年の間に歩んできた道のりを、正直に、勇気をもって、祝福しているのです。  それが ""The Captain and the Kid ""の奥深さだ。  しかし、ここでも深みにはまり込まないようにしよう。  このCDは一聴の価値ありです。  歴史に興味がなくても...ただのカジュアルなファンでも（エルトン・ジョンのカジュアルなファンでもいいのか）、いい音楽が好きでも、""The Captain and the Kid ""は最高のエンターテインメントだ。  素晴らしいアレンジ、エルトンの素晴らしいピアノ演奏、そしてもちろんフックの数々...。  誰も...そう、エルトンほどフックを書ける人はいない。  これらの曲はあなたの心に残る...あなたの旅の伴侶となり、良いワインのように、どんどん良くなっていくのです。  また、多くのアーティストが古いスタンダードやヒット曲の焼き直しをしていることについて書いている人たちに対して、応援の言葉を書かなければならない。  わかってる、わかってる、こんなものが明日をも知れぬほど売れてるんだ。  私は、ロッド・スチュワートの再演CDには耐えられないと思うが（ロッドのキャリアの大半は好きだったが、ここ5年間の彼の行動には耐えられない...ロッド...どうかやめてくれ！）、これらのCDの魅力/アピールは、購入者が信頼できるアーティストから良い（または少なくとも知られている）曲をCD1枚分得られるとわかっていることだと思う。  CDはLPよりも長いので、飽きるというリスクもありますし、実際、そうなっているものも多いですね。CDはLPより長くなりがちで、そのため息切れする危険性があり、現実的に...多くのCDがそうなっています。  悲しいかな、""The Captain and the Kid ""はチャートに火をつけることができなかった。  私にはそれが理解できない。そして、人気は偉大さとは無関係であることも理解している。しかし、このCDは本当に素晴らしいCDであり、聴く価値のある芸術作品である。  栄光の時代に逆戻りしたような作品でありながら、少しも古さを感じさせない。そして、一聴すれば...たった一聴すれば、プラットフォームシューズを履いて、黄色いレンガの道に戻ることができるのです！いや、戻ることはできないだろう...とにかく完全に戻ることはできないが、キャプテンとキッドと一緒にもう1度甘い旅に出るのはとてもいいことだ。"
1,ハンク3世は他のアーティストを酷評することで、自分が泣き虫であることを証明したに過ぎない。  この曲の中で、芸術的な能力を示唆するような曲は1つもない。  この男は他人を批判するよりも、自分の口を綺麗にして自分のことを心配する必要がある。
2,"足を叩くようなビートのある速い音楽が好きなので、カットされた ""Lucky To Know You"" だけは気に入りました。  ""Seeing Through You ""もいいんだけどね。  おそらくレイノルズは、""Lucky To Know You ""のような曲を増やしたCDを自主制作でリリースするのだろう。"
4,Be Humanは期待を裏切りません！サウンドFXとアコースティックとクラシックを織り交ぜた音質で、4starsと言ったら本気です。5つ星というのは、通常、10点という意味です。もし私が近未来劇の音響を担当することになったら、この一部を使うことで満足感を得られると思います。菅野よう子は「人生の秘密」を知っていて、その方程式を何度も何度も私たちに教えてくれていると思う。私はたまたま菅野さんの初期の作品に甘えていたので、そういう傑作に憧れるのですが、アメリカンリズムと菅野よう子のどちらかを選ぶとしたら、菅野よう子です。彼女はグラミー賞にノミネートされたことがあるのだろうか？私の中では、彼女はワールドクラスです！前にも言ったように、このCDは期待を裏切らないし、4つ星を正当化するのに十分な曲数が収録されています。心配は無用です。
5,これはコモンのリリースの中で最も好きなものの1つだ。このシカゴの戦士は、ハードコアなヒップホップ・ヘッドに活気ある笑顔をもたらし、偽のコマーシャル・ラップ・アーティストを愛する人々の心をも覚醒させるアンダーグラウンドなリリースを作り上げた。I used to love h.e.r.やressurectionのような曲は、クラシックなアルバムの始まりで、クラシックなシカゴのヒップホップへの道へとあなたを誘うだろう。歌詞だけでなく、ビートやフックもドープだ。このアルバムは、すべての人のコレクターになる必要がある重要なアルバムだ。
1,これは、私が今まで見た中で最も早い後退の記録に違いない。  彼は「U Saved Me」から、もう古くなってしまった口下手なメロドラマのようなソープオペラになった。これはすべて、彼が自分のスピリチュアリティに対して誠実でなかったことを示しています。すべての賞賛と賛美は、間違ったものを便器として使用することでフリーパスを与えられたという安心感に過ぎなかったのだ。  私は、「トラップ・イン・ザ・クローゼット」に興味を持ち、楽しませてもらったことは認める。最終的に100章に到達するまで（彼の話を聞いていると、それが彼の計画のようだ）、分割払いを延長し続けることは、受け入れがたいことだ。
2,"私は昔からR.ケリーの音楽が好きだった。  彼が ""Trapped in the Closet ""を制作したとき、私は冗談だと思った。  これは私が聞いた中で最も愚かで、最も陳腐で、最も当たり障りのない曲の1つです。"
2,"Juvenileは、そのキャリアの中で底辺と頂点を経験してきた。  90年代半ばから後半にかけて、Cash Moneyがラップ界だけでなくメインストリームのラジオでも爆発的にヒットするまで、彼はアンダーグラウンドで生き続けてきた。  しかし、その後、人々はレーベルが提供する同じような製品を聞くのに飽きた。  レーベルメイトでさえも、お互いに嫌気がさし、政治的なこともあって、脱退したり、自分の名前を世に出す他の方法を探したりする人も出てきた。  B.G.はインディペンデントの道を歩み、ホットボーイだったころのごく一部のファンにとどまった。  Turkもそれに倣ったが、やがて棒を振るのではなく、塀の中にいることに気づいた。  Juvenileは、2003年にJuve The Greatで一時的に復帰したものの、ソロの道を歩むことになった。  Atlanticに移籍したJuviは、最新作『Reality Check』で、その遅れを取り戻すことになる。  「Get Your Hustle On ""は、Juvenileが出世するために何をすべきかを知っていることを示す、アルバムの幕開けに最適なトラックだ。  Trey Songzとの ""I Know You Know ""は、ラジオで聴ける良い候補曲です。  ""アラウンド・ザ・ウェイ ""は、自分が決して離れないし、そのつもりもないことをフードに知らしめるための曲だ。  Wackoとの ""Sets Go Up ""はまあまあで、最初のシングル ""Rodeo ""は ""Back That [...] Up ""のミレニアムバージョンで、より控えめなアプローチである。  しかし、残念ながらアルバムはそこから急降下していく。  「What's Happenin'」は特筆すべきものではなく、「Loose Booty」は[...]シェイク・コミュニティに捧げた曲で、「Break A Brick Down」は意図的に他のCash Moneyの曲からビートを借用している。""Who's Ya Daddy ""は無意味で、SkipとRedd Eyezzの ""Keep Talkin'""や ""Why Not ""といった迷惑な曲と一緒だ。  Bun Bは ""Rock Like That ""でコラボすることで、またもや誤った判断を下している。  最大の衝撃は、ブライアン・マックナイトが間抜けなキャリアを歩んでいる ""Addicted ""である。ブライアンが初めて（そしてできれば最後）下品な歌詞を歌っただけでなく、ジュヴナイルはラップの代わりに詩を話すことにした（「The Rain」の最後で女性を罵倒していた時のオラン・ジュース・ジョーンズを思い出してほしい）。    Reality Check』には他にもひどい曲がたくさんあるが、わざわざ言及する気にもならない。  これは、最近の記憶では、ジュヴナイルが組んだ中で最悪のディスクに違いない。  たまに許容できる曲もあるが、『Reality Check』は、彼の大ファンで、このアルバムを買わなければ生きていけないという人以外には、コピーしたくない作品だ。  この先もラップの世界で生きていきたいのなら、Juvenileはちゃんと現実を見つめた方がいい。"
2,このディスクには2曲ほどOKな曲があるが、これは過去数年間、私のお気に入りの音楽を発表してきたLost Trailersとは全く違う。  よく練られた、物語のような歌詞も、サザン・ロックのサウンドも、もうないのだ。あの素晴らしい物語（Longfall、Pontchartrain、Love & War、West End、Dougherty County、Under FM Waves、その他多数）と素晴らしい音楽（上記の他、Red Sun、Sitting on Top of the World、Down in the Valley）は、Gravy、Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Manと誰からも聞ける同じ古いラジオ向けのカントリーサウンドにとって代わっている。  悲しい皮肉は、『Under FM Waves』（『New Age Cowboy』収録）の歌詞で、彼らがラジオからどれだけ素晴らしい音楽が消えていったかを語っていることだ。そして、何が起こったかを見てみよう：ラジオで成功するために作られた曲（当然、ビッグになるはずだが）。  他の3枚のCD（Story of the New Age Cowboy、Trailer Trash、Welcome to the Woods）を試してみてください。彼らは他にも入手困難な音楽を持っているが、この3枚は入手可能なはずだ（Trailer TrashはRock Bandの曲やWelcomeに収録された曲などをミックスしている）。  P.S.最後のレビューへ--ライダー・リーはリード・ヴォーカリストです。Geoffrey Stokes Neilsonはギタリストでありリードソングライターです。
1,BEは誇大広告に応えられない？  あの社説を書いた人は罰せられる必要がある。法廷闘士に生きる資格はない。  BEは誇大広告に応えているだけでなく、BEこそが誇大広告なのです。  コモンとカニエは、初期の頃のクインシーとマイケルを彷彿とさせる。  マイケルがまだ黒人で男性だったころのことだ。  簡単に言えば、BEは流れている。  BEがこれ以上タイトだったら、我々はそれを買う余裕がない。  飛ばしたり戻ったりする必要はない。ただ、もう一度聴かせるのに十分な曲がある。  素晴らしい芸術作品だ。  コモンとカニエ、最高！！！！
1,シェリル・クロウのニューアルバムに収録されている「Good is Good」が、グラミー賞にノミネートされたというニュースを最近読みました。これにはどれだけの時間と労力が必要だったのだろう。TNMCも発売当時、グラミー賞を受賞しています。なぜなのか、いまだに理解できないのですが、一応の仮説はあります。簡単に言うと、音楽業界は、音楽の才能や誠実さよりも、イメージに興味があるのです。シェリル・クロウは、せいぜい平凡な才能しかないのに、神格化されている。これは私の意見に過ぎないが（そして私にはそれを述べる権利がある）、このような音楽には吐き気がする。世界中には、探求し、評価されるべき音楽がたくさんあるのです。音楽業界の一部の人たちが、この種の音楽であなたを攻撃したり襲ったりしないようにしてください。私は解決策を持っています。上記のような「犯罪」を犯したレコードプロデューサーや業界関係者は全員、真の才能を認め、「SOUL」を得るために必要な時間だけ、刑務所に入るべきです。平和
1,そして、フォーク・リヴァイヴァリズムとは何かというと、皆さん、私は5つ以上のジャンルを知っているので、ポピュリストに非難されようとも、それにラベルを貼ります。  メロイは、フェアポート・コンヴェンション、ペンタングル、そして何よりもシャーリー・コリンズへの嗜好を、次から次へとインタビューで認めている。  彼は、シャーリー・コリンズがアレンジしたイギリスの伝統音楽の「カバー」アルバムも出しているが、これは馬鹿げたコンセプトである。  なぜ、伝統的な曲を他の歌手のバージョンでカバーするのか？  このバカバカしさは、メロイが英国民謡の再解釈という長い伝統から疎外されていることを示すはずだが、実際、彼の作品のほとんどはバラード作曲の弱々しい試みで構成されている。  韻律的な技術もなく、シャーリー・コリンズのレパートリーなどに倣った物語を構築していく。  明らかにメロイは、自分がウォルター・スコットやS.T.C.やジョン・キーツのようにバラードを書くことができると信じているが、彼の弱い物語は、フェアリーの国への逃避行を必死で試みるアメリカ人の想像力の貧困を随所に示している。  メロイの作品の切なさやロマンティックなノスタルジーは、NPRのヤッピー向けに計算された陳腐なものに見えてしまう。  さらに、彼の声域は雄叫び、メランコリーなワーブリング、鼻声のホワインだけで、この泣き虫のトラブルアドラーは常に風邪をひいているかのように聞こえる。  このバンドが少なくとも有能であることは認めるが、自分のために、コムスの「First Utterance」、インクレディブル・ストリング・バンドの「The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter」、シャーリー・コリンズの「No Roses」を代わりに買ってみてはいかがだろうか。
5,このアルバムでは、コリン・レイの素晴らしいテナーが存分に発揮されている。Love Me」「Little Rock」「My Kind of Girl」「Not That Different」「I Can Still Feel You」などのヒット曲が、この見事なアルバムに収録されています。レイのボーカルは、選曲もさることながら、よくできている。ほとんどの曲がレイの得意とするバラードです。コリン・レイのファンであれば、このアルバムは必携の一枚だ。
1,申し訳ないが、ラップをしようとする子供たちは、ただ恐ろしいだけだ。昔のR＆Bアーティストがティニーバッパーと呼ばれていたように、彼らはただのギミックなんだ。この子は「ヒップホップ・ティニーバッパー」になりたいんだろうね。さて、どうでしょう？ティーンエイジャーのレビューじゃなくて、大人のレビューが来るんだよ。ラップをやめて、普通の子供のように大学に行って（あるいは整備士として働いて）ください。
5,ディランとバンドはこのアルバム以前にも何度も共演しているが（ベースメント・テープや1967年のツアー）、このアルバムは初めて発表された彼らの録音で、このアルバムでのバンドの演奏は当時とは大きく異なり、ライブの「Before the Flood」とも異なっていると言わざるをえない。ガースの素晴らしいキーボードとロビーの見事なギターワークが牽引するこのアルバムからは、ほとんど負けたような、遊び心に満ちたフィーリングが感じられる。ラヴソング、ダージソング、アップリフティングソング、タフソング、トーチソング、これは時代を超えて愛されるレコードです。確かに「ブラッド・オン・ザ・トラックス」の影に隠れてしまったが、もう何年も経っているのに、「プラネット・ウェイブス」は時の試練に耐えている。私はこのレコードが本当に好きだ
1,信じられないかもしれませんが、実は私は、この音楽が良い意味で自分に合わないので、嫌いになると思っていました。私が思っていた通りの音、つまり「くだらない音」です。私に言わせれば、そんなにいい曲だと思うほどハードじゃない。落ち着きすぎているんです。{そして今、あなたは私がエンヤを好きだから偽善者だと思うかもしれません。｝少なくともエンヤは、ガレージバンドで悪い音楽を録音しようとしているような人の音ではない。私のスタイルではありません。
1,申し訳ないが、私はこれが古典的なSHRの音楽の素晴らしいアップデートバージョンになると思っていた - そして私は本当に失望した。このアルバムの意味がよくわからない。そもそも、時代を超越した、かなり完璧な音楽をなぜ「リメイク」するのか？  自分の子供がこのリメイクから何かを学ぶなんて想像もできないし（要するに、それが重要なんじゃないのか？）...それに「No More Kings」を聴くと、SHRはいつも正反対の効果を持っているのに、まさに憂鬱になった！
1,今、私は多くの人が、これは古典であり、すべての時間の中で最も創造的なCDかもしれないと言っているのを聞いたが、私は耳を傾けるとき、私はただ笑う。ミッシー・エリオットの100万倍の才能を持ち、もっとクリエイティブなラッパーはたくさんいる。正直なところ、歌詞はひどいし、ビートも2、3曲はいいんだけど、ミッシー・エリオットのうるさい声を聴いた後では、これを買った私のようにとても悔しい思いをすることになる。
1,彼女はプロデュースもラップもできないし、作曲もできない。
5,イギーのキャリアの概要だけを知りたいのであれば、これはかなり良い方法だと思う。  彼のキャリアの各セクションから少しづつ音楽が収録されている
5,"この映画のサウンドトラックは最高です！映画「ナショナル・トレジャー」（主演：ニコラス・ケイジ）が公開されて以来、私の一番のお気に入りの1つです。また、「タイタニック」のサントラもおすすめなので、興味がある方はぜひ。そして、このCDを買うかどうか迷っている人は、クリップを聴いてみてください。個人的に好きなのは""National Treasure Suite""（トラック1）です。トラック」です：""Library of Congress"" (Track 4)、""Declaration of Independence"" (Track 2)はスローな感じでいい感じです。トラック""Spectacle Discovery"" (Track 10)も私のお気に入りの一つです。このCDのいくつかのトラックは、少し繰り返しになりますが、全体として、私はこのCDはお金を払う価値があると思います。"
5,ホットボーイズ（オールドスクールキャッシュマネー）ファンなら必携のCDです
2,...このCDは買わないでください。  このCDのほとんどはエモで、かなりの部分が蛇足で、特にキャッチーでもない。  このCDにはいくつか良いバンドがあり、1、2回聴く分には十分だが、実際のパンクファンなら時間をかける価値はないだろう。  面白い音楽が混ざっているが、あまりうまくまとまってはいない。  このコンピレーションのプラス面は、1つはDropkick Murphysの曲、2つは安価であることです。  しかし、このCDを買うことをまったく忘れてしまう方が、もっと安価です
1,これをパンクと呼ぶのはどうなんだろう。シックス・フィート・アンダーかスレイヤーだろう。シボマットとか。これらのバンドを加える必要があるんだ......。イエローカードや他の粗悪なエモバンドはダメだ。
2,RBXは私のお気に入りのラッパーの一人で、ダークで不吉なスタイルを持っています。RBXは私の好きなラッパーの一人で、ダークで不吉なスタイルを持つ。しかし、ユニークでストレートなヒップホップアルバムを作るのではなく（私が期待していたものだ）。RBXがソロでやっている曲はほんの一握りで、予想通り、スヌープとダズのコラボを除けば、それらの曲が基本的にベストトラックだ。RBXに聞くが、なぜ自分のレコードレーベルに所属する才能のないアーティストを中心にアルバムを作ろうとしたのだろうか？これほどがっかりしたことはありません。このCD以外に11.99を使うくらいなら、このアルバムに費やした方がマシだ。申し訳ないが、Xはこのアルバムで才能を無駄にした。
4,"Seth Maheu ""College Student""......Your high. remedyはこのアルバムの中で一番嫌いな曲かもしれない。大嫌いだ。でも他の曲は素晴らしいよ。僕のお気に入りは ""because of me"" ""world falls away"" ""tongue"" と ""simplest mistake""。Jurrassic5は良いが、「驚くべきリリシズム」？ いいえ、Jurrassic5は楽しいから良いのであって、フォーラムラをシンプルでオールドスクールに保つ。彼はひどいし、時代遅れのギャングスターBSを作っている。彼は自分を乗り越えるべきだし、みんなが持っているヒップホップのステレオタイプを助長するのをやめるべきだ。ヒップホップは、彼、50、JA、エミネム（そう彼は昔は良かった）のような敗者のせいでひどい名前になったんだ。  このseetherのアルバムを購入する"
1,私はまだ20代ですが、コーラスラインのオリジナルアルバムを聴いて育ちました（母が掃除中によくかけていました）。そして、このリメイク版はひどいと言わざるを得ませんね。  オリジナルキャストの声には情熱があったのに、新キャストはとても退屈だ。  これは全くお勧めできない。  もしあなたが本当に音楽を愛し、感謝しているならば、オリジナルのコピーを見つけて、それをもっと楽しむことができると思います。
2,このCDを聴いて疑問に思ったことがいくつかあります。  なぜこんなにテンポが狂っているのだろう？  オープニング・ナンバーは葬送行進曲のようにのろのろと進み、「アット・ザ・バレエ」はまるで演奏者がクランクしているかのように疾走していく。  録音された伴奏トラックをバックに演奏しているのではと疑ってしまう。  なぜ、こんなに音が細いのでしょうか？  これらのオーケストラは、ライブの音響環境で最大の響きを得るために作られたものです。  このCDでは、すべての楽器が個別にマイクを当てられ、ミキシングされているような感じです。  明らかに生楽器がMIDIのように聴こえることもある。  通常、サウンドエンジニアの仕事は、その逆を実現することなのです！  なぜボーカルはあんなに「熱い」のでしょうか？  OBCでは、コーラス全体がリバーブやフルサウンドのオーケストラに圧倒されることがありました。  今は、ボーカルがバランスを崩しているのです。  この番組のキャスティングは誰なのか？  失礼にあたるので、誰か一人のキャストを挙げるつもりはありませんが...ああ、もういい。  知っておいて損はない。  このキャシーの歌声は本当に醜い。  ドナ・マッケニーさんの素晴らしい三重奏の時のように、なぜ彼女がラインでのオーディションから抜け出せないのか、ザックと一緒に考えたことは一度もない。  なぜオーケストラの一部を更新しないのか？  私はジョナサン・チュニック（彼は私の好きなブロードウェイのクリエイティブタイプのトップ3に入る）を深く深く尊敬していますが、今は2006年です。  ワウワウペダルはもう古い。  全体として、このCDは完全主義者にとっては良いものですが、OBCの録音をA CHORUS LINEの決定的な録音としてノックアウトすることはできないでしょう。  もしコーラスラインのCDを持っていなくて、どれを買おうか迷っているのなら、ブロードウェイのオリジナルキャストのリマスター盤を探し出してみてください。  ヴィンテージですが、リバイバル・キャストにはない生の暖かさがあります。
2,彼らの音楽が変わっていないと言ったあのバカは、とても間抜けで、明らかに真のSOADファンではない。僕はSOADがまだ小さなバンドで可能性を秘めていた頃からファンだったんだ。SOADは素晴らしいアルバムだったし、Toxicityは甘かったし、Steal This Albumは本当に素晴らしい音楽の冒険だった。もし僕がこのレビューを書いていて、これが彼らのデビューアルバムだったら、全体的に素晴らしいアルバムで、正直に言うと4.5/5点だ。しかし、彼らの初期の作品と比較すると、このアルバムは全く駄目だ。彼らの昔の作品は、このゴミよりずっと良かった。そして、Daronは歌の時間を多く取ろうとするのを止めるべきだ。彼は本当にそんなに良いシンガーではないし、Serjはもっと良い。
5,アラン・ジャクソンのベストを集めた絶対的な名盤で、フィラーを排除している。  必携の一枚です。  ところで、アラン・ジャクソンの「ソングライティング・スキルに課題がある」と指摘した2001年9月2日のレビュアーは、もうみんな笑っているのだろうか！
4,"1987年、バリー、ロビン、モーリスが再集結した！少なくとも、配給会社のワーナー・ブラザーズはそう売り込もうとしたのです。  兄弟が自分たちや私たちから離れることはなかったのに、話はそれますが。  ワーナー・ブラザーズはリリースを非常に希少なものにしたようなので、私はこのアルバムをcdrで持っているだけです。  ジャケットはかっこいいんだけどね。  少年たちは、観客が最後に記憶したときとはまったく違う姿をしている。白髪もなく、髪もなく、とにかくそれほどでもない。  黒だ。ダークでエッジが効いている。  僕はピップ、遊びに来たんだ！          ESPは当然ながら、アルバムの冒頭を飾る曲です。  当時のブラザーズが手がけた他のどのプロジェクトとも違う。  Walls Have Eyes』よりも良く、『Now Voyager』よりも洗練されている。  しかし、ESPはこのアルバムの中で非常に独立した曲であり、他の曲はこの曲のようには聴こえない。  (Living Eyesでは、ロビンのカミングアウト・ヴォイス・パーティーが聴けたが、バズと共有した曲である。  バリーはヘビーなプロデュースに移ったけど、ロビンはいなかった。  ESPは、この2人を再び引き合わせ、2人の強豪を叩きのめす。  この曲にはたくさんのことが起こっていて、テレパスが聴いているような感覚になる。ノイズ、それぞれが自分の意見を持とうとし、聞こえてくる他のすべてのものと競合し、そのすべてが重要である。  ブリリアント。          Ah, You Win Again.  アメリカではフィーバーモンスターズほど知られていないが、この曲はまさにモンスターソングのひとつであり、愛すべき曲である。  音楽的にも、歌詞的にも、ボーカル的にも、たくさんのフック、ライン、シンカーがある。2番の「Nobody stops this body」の遊びから、ロビンのOh Baby！の叫び、そして全体を通しての爆音ドラムまで。  熱いぜ。  この曲は実際にUSチャートにまで進出しているんだ！         Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child) (彼らと括弧は何なんだ？)は、最初に紹介したスローな曲です。  バリーは再び高音に戻り、対訳を理解するのが難しいこともあります。  コーラスは力強く、歌詞はいつものように一流です。  アドリブの効いた大仰なエンディングは、完璧な80年代パワーバラードファッションです。  音楽と高い声は少し古いですが、深夜に一人で家に帰るときに一緒に歌おうとせずにはいられないのは私だけでしょうか？          Giving Up The GhostはWalls Have Eyesの楽曲に少し似ているが、それはそれでいい。素晴らしい音楽が流れている。  リフレインのいくつかはちょっとやりすぎで、コーラスが曲の弱い部分と言えるかもしれない。そしてまた、少年たちが`グーオスト！'と掲げて、またカッコよく聞こえる。  ロビンは、7割方理解できるので、節回しは最高です;0)        The Longest Nightは、Bodyguardと同様、私の中ではBee Geesの曲の中で最もホットな曲の一つです。  80年代前半のソロやサイドプロジェクトの後、兄弟は再びESPのために強くなって戻ってきました。  ロビンはこの曲で、ウィーピング・ジョーク・サウンドとフィーバー後に開発したブーミング・ヴォイスをどうにか融合させることに成功した。  ビブラートは常にあったが、80年代の5時の影のようなサウンドは、60年代のメローなサウンドと同じように、ロビンの心に響く歌詞に合っていた。   この『ESP』と『Walls Have Eyes』は、誰もが聴き逃したギブ・ミュージックの傑作である。残念だ。          どのアルバムにも楽しい曲があるものだが、『This Is Your Life』はESPの曲だ。   ブラザーズが復活して、過去の音楽を笑い飛ばしながら受け入れているのを見るのはいいことだ。  間奏では、ビージーズの他の曲のタイトルが歌詞に「ラインドロップ」されています。  JJJive Talkin'を歌ったのはこの時だけだ！  バリーのラップなんだけど、昔の曲の歌詞がぽつぽつとカットインしてくる。とてもクールだ。  必要であれば、この間奏曲だけでアルバム全体を薦めることもできるのですが、そうではありません。         甘く柔らかい歌詞とヴォーカル以外では、Angelaは私の中ではちょっとステートメント的な曲です。   Angela」を「America」に置き換えてもいいような気がすることがあります。  I'm still alive（僕はまだ生きている）」というセリフに続いて、彼らは私たち頑固なアメリカ人に向けてベールに包まれた言葉を発したのだろうかと思います。  確かに彼らはまだ生きていた。そして、これはStayin'のダジャレでもあるのだろう。アライブ。ニューヨークタイムズは男を効果するんだ、覚えとけよ ;0)  曲の感じはとても無邪気で簡単な感じですが、私はもっと疑っています！  逃げ出した女の子？そうじゃないと思う。          モーリスはこのアルバムをOvernightで一段落させます。  この曲はESPという曲に最も近い系統の曲です。  しかし、モーリスはテレパシーではなく、動物的な磁力を加えている。  別の意味でのサイキックセンスだ。  歌詞はとても細かく、3人の声の響きを組み合わせた間奏は格別です。  音楽は、もしそういうものがあるとすれば、捕食的な感じがして良いですね。  曲の終わりには完全に売られ、""よし、残るぞ！""と叫び返される。         80年代以降の『High Civilization』では、ブラザーズはモータウンのトリビュート・リバイバルのようなことをやっているようです。Crazy For Your Loveは、モータウンの回帰的な雰囲気を持ちながら、同時に80年代のバブルガム・ポップであるという点で魅力的です。  (ティファニー、誰かいる？）今のティーンが愛とアイスクリームの歌を歌うのを聞いたら、私はぞっとするだろう。  しかし、今の子供たちにクレイジーを聞かせれば、彼らはそれを気に入るだろうし、それが1987年に老人が歌っているものだとは決して気づかないだろう！  このようなタイムレスな曲をここで見つけるとは、なんと独創的なことでしょう！         Backtafunkは、従来のギブの曲とは異なります。  ちょっと...ニュー・エディションみたいな感じですね！当然ながら、兄弟はヒップ・ビートと歌のすべてをマスターしている、たとえ歌詞が少し退屈でも。  しかし、この曲もまた、ブレイクアウェイ・インタールードがこの曲を作り上げている。  少年たちのハーモニーと楽しさが入ってきて、曲はさらにレベルアップする。  バリーはスキャットをしているのでしょうか？信じられない！         ESPはESPボーカル・リプライズで終わりますが、なぜだかよくわかりません。  1曲目の歌声が冒頭でエコーされるだけなのだが、クールなサウンドだ。ESPにまつわる奇妙なものを紹介させてください、ご存知の通りです！Young Loveはアルバムに収録されなかった未発表カットです。  短くカットした作品をダウンロードすることができたが、ローキーなモーリスの流れを汲むヘビーな作品だ。  正直なところ、なぜカットされたのかわからない。  1989年のコンピレーション『Tales From The Brothers Gibb』には、プロダクション・マークが少し欠けているだけで、最終バージョンに非常によく似たESP Demoが収録されています。  また、ファンは『The One For All Tour』のVHSとDVDで、Giving Up The Ghostを歌う彼らのコンサート映像や『One』のエキストラをチェックするとよい。          ワーナー・ブラザーズは、ビージーズのクオリティを理解していないようだ。  このアルバムには何かテーマがあるのだろうか？それぞれの曲は異なるタイプの感情や雰囲気に触れているし、ある意味、歌は人から人へのサイキックなつながりなのでは？面白い理論だね、クリスティン。興味深いですね。"
1,フーバ...クサい...クサい、これからもずっとクサい。他のCDはどうか知らないが、The Reasonを聴くのは、動いているゴミ処理機に手を突っ込むのと同じくらい気持ちがいいものだ。  私は完璧なペルソナではありません。エガド
1,最初にこれを聞いたとき、私はただ言葉を失いました。10年前に地球上で最高のヘビーメタルバンドと呼ばれていたものが、玉も歯もないライオンになってしまった。カントリーに影響された曲！？スローでブルースに影響された曲？そんなのありえないし、ありがたくもない。  また、非常に過大評価されているアルバムです。ブラックアルバムはOKAYだったが、私の中では3つ星だ。しかし、これは彼らにとって急な右折であり、メタリカの終わりの始まりだった。PS: The Memory RemainsとUnforgiven 2はHORRIBLE SONGSだ。
5,この人たちは今、最高のグループだよ。どのラッパーも素晴らしいし、フローに関してはイマイチだけど、おそらく一番面白い歌詞を書くBizarreも素晴らしい。このアルバムは、Sh*t Can Happen、Pistol Pistol、Ain't Nuttin' But Music、American Psycho、Fight Music、Revelationなど、今までで一番好きな曲をいくつももたらしてくれました。僕の好きなラッパーはSwiftyとEminemだけど、実はどのラッパーも今頃ソロアルバムを出しているはずだ（Emの他にはProof（R.I.P.）とBizarreだけ...彼らはグループの中で一番嫌いなラッパーだ）。どの曲も素晴らしいし、寸劇も楽しい。もしこれをまだ持っていないなら、あなたは今までで最高のCDの1つを逃している。
5,OK...ここには、彼女のハリウッド映画から知らない曲がたくさんあるかもしれませんが、それを止めないでください。  彼女は素晴らしく、楽しいです！  他のレビュアーは、これに失望したと言っています。
5,このミュージカルの音楽は、驚くほどABBAの音楽に忠実であり、その音楽を披露するために書かれたストーリーラインでもあります。  私が見たのはラスベガスのプロダクションで、オリジナルのロンドンプロダクションではありませんでしたが、ラスベガスのプロダクションで歌われ演奏された音楽は、オリジナルのプロダクションのものと同じように素晴らしいものでした。もしあなたがABBAが好きで（好きでない人はいないでしょう）、チケット代が払えないなら、このDVDは次善の策です。
5,このアルバムをもっと早く手に入れられなかったことが唯一の後悔です。  音楽も歌詞もリアルで気負いがない。  ウェイン・ハンコックはアメリカの真の宝石だ
1,私はあなたのチームのベイビーたちですが、このCDは私には合いませんでした。しかし、私はまだあなたのチームです。あなたの最新作を持っていて、何度も何度も再生しています。CDの1と3はどちらも必需品です。
2,"Jerry, si estas leyendo esto：Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional.Te queremos mucho!!!  Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como del tiempo de ""Cuenta Conmigo"", ""Cara de Nino"", and ""Magia""....  レゲトンに影響されることはない！No me malinterpretes: Hasta tu disco ""Vuela muy alto"" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda.Seguire escounando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno newvo.

5,"""The Who Sell Out ""は、いくつかのWhoの傑作のうちの1つです（少なくとも3つ）。曲の間にコマーシャルが入る商業ラジオ局の番組として作られ、全体的に素晴らしい曲作りで、このアルバムは最も変化に富み、最も面白いフーのアルバムと言えるかもしれません。  1967年は、ロック音楽におけるサイケデリアの年であり、ザ・フーはその流れの先駆者の一人であった。このことは、アルバムの1曲目「アルメニア・イン・ザ・スカイ」を聴けば一目瞭然だ。優れたシングル曲「I Can See For Miles」は、録音されたサイケデリアの中でも非常に優れた曲のひとつです。   アコースティックな「Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand」は、美しいメロディ、素晴らしいリズム、そして知的な歌詞で、フーのお気に入りの1曲です。  実際、このアルバムでは歌詞が全体的に素晴らしく、ウィットとユーモアにあふれています。  Odorono」や「Tattoo」のような曲は、Whoのコンピレーションにはほとんど収録されておらず、このアルバムを初めて聴く人にとって、大きなポジティブ・サプライズとなるに違いない。   また、""Our Love Was ""や ""I Can't Reach ""は、前作 ""A Quick One ""のスタイルに近い、素晴らしい曲です。   短いコマーシャル（そのほとんどが音楽的に仕上げられている）は、最初の2、3回は聴くとイライラするのではないかと思っていたが、実際はそうでもない。これらの短いトラックは、アルバムの文脈の中で素晴らしい働きをします。   オリジナル・アルバムの最後の2曲だけが、少し場違いな感じがする。タウンゼントのアコースティックな「Sunrise」はとても美しいが、「Rael」はやや長回しで時代遅れな感じがする。  ボーナストラックのほとんどは素晴らしいもので、レコード盤のスペース不足のために省かれたものらしい。   ボーナストラックは、オリジナルとうまく調和している。"
5,このアルバムは、伝説のバンド「ザ・フー」の音楽的な卓越性を示している。グリーン・デイやリンプ・ビズキットといった今日のグループが、フーの足元にも及ばないというのも興味深い。そして、この掲示板のレビュアーであるオリオンさん、あなたは悲しいケースですね、私の友人です。私は、あなたが必死に必要としている心理的な助けをうまく探し出すことを心から願っています。
1,The Whoには才能がない。過大評価されているし、まともな曲は『Wont Get Fooled Again』の1曲だけだ。この最低のコンピレーションは避けて、代わりにDire Straits Making Moviesを手に入れよう。
4,"私がMCRを知ったのはThree cheers for sweet revengeで、このアルバムはベスト盤の一つです。I brought you my bullets, you brought me your loveはとてもとても良いリリースです。どの曲も素晴らしいし、最初に私をMCRに引き込んだ激しさと獰猛さは、このアルバムでも十分に発揮されています。しかし、このアルバムではまだ自分たちのサウンドと方向性を見つけられていなかったようだ。とても良いアルバムだが、録音はとても生々しく、半オッケーなプロダクションである。しかし、それにもかかわらず、チェックしなければならない素晴らしいリリースです・・・私のお気に入りの曲はDrowning lessonsです。"
1,このゴミをギャングスタ呼ばわりするバカがここに来るとはな。カリは本物のライダーが生きて死ぬ場所であって、ダーティな場所ではない。90年代半ばからみんな西海岸に食いついたが、今回も例外ではない。THA FRONTLINERZに''GANGSTA IN ME''という曲があるが、彼らはいわゆるギャングスタが自らをトラップN66AZと呼ぶことに対してそれを正した。このレコードはウォールマートの棚に並んでいるんだ！！これを聞いて大笑いしたよ。BOYS N DA HOOD...君たちカモがいかに西海岸に噛みつくかのもう一つの例だね。
4,デイブ・トーマスは、ハンバーガーチェーン「ウェンディーズ」の創業者でありスポークスマンであると同時に、ペール・ユビュのリーダーでもあったことをご存知の方は少ないだろう。昔ながらのハンバーガーを売って財を成したトーマス氏は、明らかにお金のためではなく、自分の音楽のミューズを自由に追求することができたのである。しかし、この生々しく情熱的な音楽を特徴づけているのは、常にデイヴ・トーマスのユニークなスタイルである。もし、Carl's Juniorの創設者であるCarl Karcherが、このように自由奔放に、そして経済的な問題から解放されて音楽を追求していたら、どうなっていただろうかと考えてしまう。
1,最悪だ！！！」！この曲の多くは、地獄...つまりフロリダでの最初の数ヶ月間に私の耳で体験されたものです。このアルバムで最初に聴いたのは「Today」で、最初に聴いた時は30秒の断片だったので良い曲だと思ったのですが、全曲を聴くと憂鬱になりましたし、初日から大嫌いだった「Disarm」もありましたし、「Cherub Rock」もそうでした。こんな時に買うんじゃなかったという気さえしてしまうのだが、まあ仕方ないかと割り切っていたのだろう。しかし、「マヨネーズ」だけは辛うじて許せるので、90年代最悪の1枚と割り切ろうと思っています。
1,このCDは完全な誤報です。  多くの曲は、非常に出来の悪いコンサートバージョンの曲です。  数曲で全く同じ観客の歓声のトラックまで使っている。  このCDは、自分のコレクションに欠けている曲を補いたいファンだけが購入すればいい。  オリジナルのヒット曲をすべて手に入れられると思って買わないでください。  14曲はライブです。  1曲は再録音と思われる。  残りはオリジナルです。  また、CD#2では、メディアタグの多くが間違っています。  All I Really Need Is You」（Live）を再生すると、「Heartbreak Hotel」というタイトルが表示されます。  Headed for the Future」を再生すると、曲名「All I Really Need Is You」が表示されます。  Heartbreak Hotel」を再生すると、「Headed for the Future」という曲名が表示されます。  全体的に、彼らは明らかに品質を気にせず、市場に急行しただけの非常にずさんなプロジェクトである。
2,ロック音楽、特にエモパンクの教養がある私は、このCDを最後まで聴こうとするたびに気分が悪くなりました。 なぜかというと、このアルバムはエモの中でもあまり良くない部類に入るからです（完全に酷いわけではありませんが）。このバンドは、自分の「音楽の天才」を自慢してはいけないシンガーが率いているという事実、そして自分の声が他のほとんどのエモシンガーと比べてどれだけ嫌な音なのかをまず認識すべきなのにそれを甘くしていない。このアルバムを買ったとき、ステッカーが貼ってあった。「Taking Back Sunday、Brand New、The Usedが好きなら、Matchbook Romanceも気に入るはず！」これを読んだとき、彼らがどれだけ必死かわかるはずだった。しかしもっと気になるのは、彼らがあえてTaking Back Sundayと比較したという事実だろう。TBSはエモバンドで、レコチョクではありません。ブランド・ニューは、「デジャ・アンタンドゥ」を聴いたことがありますか？あのアルバムは、最高のエモアルバムというだけでなく、あらゆるジャンルのベストアルバムの1つです。
5,アルフォンソ・ロサダは的外れなことを言ったと思う。この映画は、トニー・ウィルソンという一人の人間の人生のスパンを描いており、そのため彼の体験を中心に構成されている。同時に、この映画はドキュメンタリーではなく、フィクションである。そのうえで、トニーというキャラクターは、ストーン・ローゼズが過小評価されていることに言及している。サウンドトラック・アルバムに、映画に登場しないアーティストが含まれていないのは、本当に驚きなのだろうか。
4,私の場合、好きだけどリードシンガーの声のせいで数曲しか聴けないというバンドが常に存在する。例えば、マルーン5、ビリー・タレント、クラップ・ユア・ハンズ・セイ・イェーなどがそうです。これらのバンドがユニークであることに拍手を送りたいが、CD1枚まるまる聴くのは大変だ。Hot Hot Heatは、私が今まで持っていた唯一の例外の一つです。彼らのCDは何度聴いても、3曲目、4曲目で止める必要がないのです。どんなものでもイライラすることはありますが、ホット・ホット・ヒートは私の心をつかむのにかなり時間がかかります。私はスノウ・パトロールやアークティック・モンキーズのような新しいイギリスのバンドもあまり好きではありませんが、ホット・ホット・ヒートはまた、私の心に残る何かを持っています。Make Up The Breakdownと同様にこのCDをお勧めします。とても良い、アップビートな曲で、帰りの車の中で心ゆくまで楽しむことができる。
5,今年出たR&Bの女性アルバムの中で一番いい作品です。私は一日中このCDを聴いています。他のアルバムと同じように10曲収録されていますが、モニカは多くの女性に共感され、何かを語っています。モニカは言いたいことがあり、世の中の多くの女性に共感している。私はこのCDが大好きです。特に私のようにBDayでお金を無駄にした人は、すぐに買ってください。
5,"CrossfadeはモダンロックのAlt Metalバンドに過ぎないかもしれないが、だからといって彼らを悪いとは思わない。確かに、彼らは今の音楽に新しいものを加えてはいないけど、だからといって音楽そのものを否定することはない。私が知っているのは、私が聞いたものから、彼らは本当に良いトラックを持っているということだけです。Cold ""という曲をラジオで初めて聴いたとき、すぐに気に入ったんだ。アルバムを買わなければと思いました。アルバムを手に入れた後、それはかなり良いものになった。このアルバムに収録されているすべての曲を楽しむことができました。でも、私のお気に入りの曲は、「Cold」、「Starless」、「Colors」、「Dead Skin」でしょう。以下、曲の評価です...  1.Starless - 9.5/10 2.コールド - 10/10 3.So Far Away - 9.5/10 4.カラーズ - 10/10 5.デス・トレンド・セッタ - 10/10 6.ディープエンド - 9/10 7.ノーギビングアップ - 9.5/10 8.デッドスキン - 10/10 9.ディスコ - 7/10 10.The Unknown - 9/10 総合：93% A- 確かに、新しい何かがあるわけではないが、それは良いことであり、良い聴きものである。このアルバムはとても楽しめたし、Crossfadeがリリースしたばかりの新しいアルバムでどんなことをやっているのかとても興味がある。とにかく、このスタイルの音楽に興味がある人なら、おそらく自分の音楽コレクションに他の良いトラックをたくさん見つけることになるでしょう。"
4,アウト・オブ・エグザイル』は、デビュー作と同じく、転がるようなリフにのってブロックから飛び出し、彼らがクラシックなハードロックの伝承を実際に身に付けていることを改めて確認させてくれる。また、リック・ルービンがノブを操作して、成熟したハード・ロックの素晴らしいセレクションを提供している。クリス・コーネルは、歌詞に様々な感情を込めることができる声の持ち主である。コーネルがすべての歌詞を書くという事実は興味深い。このバンドが、いまだに語り継がれている前バンドの後にどのように活動するかを考えなければならないという事実は、この男たちが乗り越えなければならないもう一つのハードルだった。でも、それができたのはラッキーだったね。  このAudioslaveのストーリーの第2弾は、第1弾と同じようなサウンドで、悪いことではありません。リフはとても滑らかで、誰が70年代を取り戻したのだろう？- そして、バンドはロックとメロウな曲を交互に演奏する方法を十分に示している。このアルバムは全体的に少しメロウになったような気がする。そのためかどうかはわからないが、デビュー作にあった曲数が多すぎるという若干の問題をバンドは改善した。  このアルバムによって、批判的な人たちは黙らされたことだろう。ハードロックには、ヒステリックなバンドの箔付けとして、このようなギミックのないバンドが必要なのである。最終的には、才能あるプレイヤーによるハードロックと、メロディを乗せるための転がるようなリフが好きな人にとって、これは4つ星のリリースと言えるでしょう。  音楽的なこと以外の不満な点 - なぜ、つまらないジャケットなのか？
5,映画も素晴らしいですが、このCDも同じくらい素晴らしいです。  静かで平和な音楽から、最後のフィナーレのフルオーケストラまで、畏敬の念を抱かせる、史上最高のサウンドトラックのひとつです！  自分自身や友人への素晴らしい贈り物です。
2,私は「Carry On Wayward Son」という曲は絶対に好きでした。このアルバムの他の曲はそれほど良いものではありません。星2つ
4,これは、言語、意味論、リズムに関するやや興味深い探求である。  解体された会話を新しい異なる文脈で表現することで、よりシュールな雰囲気を醸し出しています。  韓国のサムルノリを彷彿とさせるものもあり、この音楽は主に韓国語に基づくパーカッションとリズムに依存している（その非常に明確な例として、第6番「地図氏のアニメーションの説明」を聴いてみてください）。  いくつかの曲は非常に魅力的で、従来の音楽とは異なる音楽的探求を示唆しているが、楽器編成の同一性には問題があり、音楽的発展の欠如のために非常に面白くないことがある。もし、彼らがアイデアや楽器編成の音楽的発展にもっと時間を費やせば、ブックスは非常に良い結果を出すことができるだろう。  サンプルを重ねるだけでは、飽きられる前に限界がある。
1,ノップラーはまたしても、遠い昔のダイアー・ストレイツの時代に内在していた期待にはるかに及ばない。おそらく彼はアトキンス氏の生まれ変わりを試みているのだろうが、もしそうなら、白い靴を買ってフロリダに引っ越すべきだろう。簡単に言うと、ほとんどお勧めできないひどいアルバムである。
1,これはもっと素晴らしいYES-Jon Andersonのクリスマス音楽だと思った人たちに申し訳ないです。  私は3シップスのCDが廃盤になった後、実際に見つけた数少ない幸運な人間の一人です。  30ドル以上払ったが、1ペニーの価値もある。  mp3をリッピングして配るのが違法なのは残念ですが、シェアしたいですからね！  3シップスを復活させよう！」請願書に私の名前を追加してください。
5,What's Left of Me』では、Nick Lacheyが失恋と傷心について、CDの全編にわたって歌っている。  これはNo DoubtのTragic KingdomのCDの彼バージョンである。  どの曲も失恋について歌っている。  歌詞はとても良く、曲もとても良くできている。  彼のSoulOのアップビートなふわふわ感を求めている人は、このCDを買わないでください。  このCDのトーンは悲しいです。  ほとんどの曲はバラードです。  しかし、スローバラードではなく、ポップ・ロック・パワーバラードのような感じです。  彼は素晴らしい声を持っています。  力強く、素晴らしいトーンを持っている。  私が今まで聴いたすべてのボーイバンダーの中で、彼は最も才能があると言えるでしょう。  彼の声は強いだけでなく、女の子ではなく男のように聞こえるので素晴らしいです（例：Justin Timberlake）。  特に印象的な曲はI Can't Hate You Anymore」「On Your Own」「Beautiful」です。  他の曲もいい。  このCDでようやく、彼は正統派の音楽スターになったのだ。
2,このCDは、南部ラップなのであまり考えずにプレゼントとして受け取ったのですが、このCDにはほとんどリリックの才能がありません。  今の南部ラップのほとんどと同じように、重低音はあるが、叙情的な才能はない。  もしあなたがラップ（メインストリームラップ）が好きな無知な子供の一人なら、このCDを楽しむことができるかもしれませんね。
1,ショーはロック、サウンドトラックは最悪です。ショーの曲は全く分からなかった。それだけでこのサウンドトラックがいかに印象に残るか分かる。このサウンドトラックがいかに印象に残らないか、それだけでわかる：
1,私はファーストアルバムが好きで、このジャンルの愛好家のふりをするつもりはありませんが、私が学んだいくつかのこと：1）喉頭炎のタッチでラップしないでください2）多分ビートと一緒に歌う/ラップ、その近くだけではありません3）「私の人生は最悪です」と「誰もが私を憎む」トラックをドロップ - おっとそれはアルバム全体です4）私は世界がラップ悲しいピアノバラード以上のものに耐えられるとは思わない5）すべてのバックグラウンドシンガーに優れた声を持っているなら、おそらくあなたは終わっています誰か中古CDを買ってみたい。
2,"ケイト・ブッシュのセカンド・アルバム『ライオンハート』は、彼女のカタログの中で最も弱い作品かもしれない。  ブッシュが「ザ・キック・インサイド・パート2」を作るという罠にはまりたくなかったのは明らかで、その代わりに様々な方向に手を伸ばし、いくつかは成功し、いくつかはそうでなかった。  音楽的には、最初のアルバムに似たバラード（「ピーターパンを探して」、「暖かい部屋で」）、よりポップな構成（「Wow」）、リズムのシフト（「ハートブレーキに足を乗せるな」）、ほとんどシャッフル（「フルハウス」）、グレートロック（「ハンマーホラー」）などがある。  リリックでは、ブッシュは作品に官能的なレベルを加え（「シンフォニー・イン・ブルー」）、論争的なテーマから遠ざかる気配はない（「カシュカ・フロム・バグダッド」）。  しかし、問題は、このアルバムが私の中でうまくまとまっていないことである。  初期のブッシュなら、彼女のデビュー作（""The Kick Inside""）や見事な ""Never For Ever ""を試してみてください。"
2,このCDは良くない。  幸いなことに、中古で5ドルしか払っていない。  つまり、私たちは本当に不完全な曲を聴きたいのでしょうか？  私はそう思わない。  実際に完成した2曲はかなり良いので、星1つに値するのとは対照的に、星2つです。  ブルースは本当にジーンを見習って、金儲けに走ったんだ。  EPであるべきで、それ以上のものはない。
2,このCDは音質が良くない、つまり制作が不十分だったということだ。1999年のCDはもっと音質が良いはずです。他のレビュアーが述べているように、私もレスラーのテーマソングがそれぞれ約1分であることに失望した。もっと長くてもいいし、解説者があちこちで言う無関係な発言はなくてもよかったと思う。不思議なことに、NWOの音楽はどこにあるのだろう。
1,聞いて痛い、見て痛い。  辞める勇気がない、往年のポップシンガー。  何もすることがないから、スポットライトを浴び続けるために、無意味なアルバムを次々と発表し続ける。これが最高のエゴイズムでないとしたら、何がそうなのか分からない。  名声もあり、財産もあり、ヒット曲もあったのに、なぜもう消えてしまわないのか。  彼女が初期の頃、衝撃的な価値を求めてやっていたことが、今ではとても陳腐で哀れなものに思える。  この女性は、中身がほとんどない見世物に過ぎない。  彼女は自己宣伝のために、セックスから宗教まで何でも利用する。  マドンナがなぜ同じ結論に達しないのか、私には理解できない。  このCDは、今月のフレーバーとしては良いが、その賞味期限はとうに過ぎている。  私はマドンナに、彼女のショーを支配しているおふざけやあからさまな性的描写のないコンサートを開くことに挑戦します。そんなことをしたら、彼女はステージからすぐにブーイングされるでしょう。  そして、磔にされるような演出はもう十分にしてください。  
4,このアルバムこそがgooの全てだ......彼らはここでBESTだった!!!!!!！  このアルバムは、彼らが二度とpruduceすることができないであろうクラシックなアルバムだった
1,Nellyの2ndアルバムは、1stアルバムと同じようにひどい出来だった。Hot In Herreという曲はリードオフシングルとしてはまともだったので、彼は少しは正気に戻ったかもしれないと思ったのです。しかし、私は間違っていた。さらに歌が増え、今度はデスティニーズ・チャイルドのケリー・ローランドとデリマという曲で共演し、ジャスティン・ティンバーレイクとの曲もある。また、ヒップホップのレジェンドであるKRS-Oneの曲はもちろんのこと、Beanie SiegelのRoc Tha Mic (Remix)を自分のCDに収録し、私を感動させようと試みている。聴く価値のあるトラックは#1で、おそらく彼が自分で作った曲の中で唯一聴く価値のあるものだ。それ以外の曲はダメなんだ。ケリー・ローランドと組んだ曲はオールディーズのラジオ局で聴くことができるんだ。もういい加減にしてほしい。
5,ボブはキングです！  ザ・KINGです！  このディスクを手に入れろ、きっと気に入るはずだ。  このCDには、本当に緊急性が感じられるよ。  ボブのサイトに行って、アルバムに関する彼のメモをいくつか見てみてください。  もしテキサス州オースティンに行けるなら、2週間くらいかけてボブのライブに行けばわかると思う。  Joe RockheadからTexas Bluegrass Masacreまで、Bobは常に境界線を押し広げ、新しいサウンドを生み出し、企業化されていない、ストレートなロックンロールを奏でる本物のアーティストなのだ。
5,私は、彼が今までしてきたことすべてを、本当の彼女
5,レビューを読んで時間を無駄にするのはやめましょう。  このアルバムを手に入れよう
1,私はスプリングスティーンの大ファンではありませんが、彼が過去にやったことの多くは好きです。この作品にはお金を無駄にしました。気のないつぶやきにしか聞こえない。音楽的にもボーカル的にも、曲のバリエーションが全くと言っていいほどない。何も目立っていない。実験的なこともない。曲の中には良いストーリーラインもあるかもしれないが、とにかく普段は彼のことを理解できない。2曲ほど気に入りましたが、アルバムを取り出して電源を入れるほどではありません。数回聴いただけでは、再生したいと思うことはない。大ファンで彼の全曲が欲しいという人以外は、このアルバムにがっかりするかもしれません。
1,このCDを買ったのはかなり前のことです。おそらくとても良いものだと思いますが、私のステレオで再生できないのにどうやって見分けるのでしょうか。このデュアルディスクフォーマットは、長年のファンを騙す音楽業界の方法です。このファンへの粘着はまさに最低です。ディスクを買った後、私は裏面の小さな警告に気が付きました。「ディスクのオーディオ側はCD仕様に準拠していないため、すべてのCDプレーヤーでこのディスクのオーディオ側を再生できない」です。すべての人に再生できないディスクを売るというのは、なんという素晴らしいアイデアなのでしょう。ありがとうA.ホール
5,"私は真のスムースジャズファンですが、これはブライアンが作った最高のCDだと言わざるを得ません。Come on up ""も良いですが、""Nice and Slow ""は最高です。一度でも聴いたら病みつきになりますよ。                                   "
5,ニコラス・レイズはこの音楽に絶対的に完璧な声を持っている...エネルギッシュなリズムの素晴らしいコレクションで、あなたの動きを止めない  
1,LIVE FROM BUFFALOのような情熱的な音楽が好きなグループにとって、この曲はまるで葬式のようなものです。フルアルバムをリリースしていないのは、彼らをファンにしてきた情熱を再び呼び起こそうとしているのだと願うばかりだ。  じっくりと時間をかけて、あなたのBEST作品を手に入れましょう。   T
5,このアルバムを5つ星と評価したのは、4.9つ星をやらせてくれなかったからです。3:16は完璧なLPでした。これは非常に近いです。3:16のWalk Like A Manのような際立った曲はありませんが、それでもこのCDは今までで最高の1枚です。  私はMursのCDを3枚持っています。The end of the beginning、3:16、そして今回のMurray's Revengeです。トラック6のDreamchaserは、一日中リピートする価値があります。このCDの中で一番好きな曲です。  このCDに収録されている曲はすべてソリッドだ。   Mursと彼のスタイルを理解しようとする人にとって、彼はKanye Westのようなサンプルをビートにたくさん使っているし、彼のフローは、まあ、彼は彼自身のリーグにいる。今日、そしておそらくすべての時間の中で最高のリリシストの一人だ。彼はアンダーグラウンドではないし、まだビッグでもない。彼は放送されるに値する。彼のトラックは、例えばNellyやLittle Jonのような、それを狙ったものではないんだ。  僕が言えるのは、Mursはこの業界でトップクラスのEmceesになるべきだということだ。そして、僕の意見では、彼は圧倒的にそうだ。MursとMos DefやThe Rootsのコラボレーションが見られたら面白いかもしれない。  以上、このCDを買おう
5,"Bow Wow Wowは有名ではない。彼らはアメリカで ""I want Candy ""で1度チャートインした（トップ50）だけで、ちゃんとしたアルバムは3枚しか出していない。彼らのサウンドはトライバルで、リードシンガーAnnabellaはパーカッシブなドラムとドキドキするベースに合わせてしばしば叫び、そのミックスから多くの素晴らしい曲が生まれるが、それは慣れが必要で、私にとってもそうで、よく聞くまでファンではなかった...もしあなたがこのグループの曲をあまり知らないのであれば、この曲が消化できるかどうかを知るために、できるだけ多くの30秒サンプルを聴くことをお勧めします：このCDには、""Sexy Effiel Tower""（14歳のアナベラがドナ・サマーよりも本格的にオーガズムを表現したパンツ）や ""Radio G String""、そしてこのCDから異なるバージョンで3曲のカットが収録されています；しかしここから始めて、あなたがこのCDを崇拝しない限り、これ以上は進まないでください...。"
5,Rasputinaのアルバムの中でもトップクラスに好きなアルバムです。素晴らしい曲の数々、冗談のような曲の少なさ、そして素晴らしいアートワーク。
5,クリス・コーネルはAudioslaveで知ってから、2年ぐらい聴いています。その後「Black Hole Sun」「Spoonman」を聴いて、それ以降サウンドガーデンのことはほとんど忘れていました。ある日、友人がこのCDを貸してくれたのですが、1〜2ヶ月忘れていて、昨日やっと聴いたのですが、まあ・・・すごい。まず、クリス・コーネルはロック界で最も強く、最も認知度の高い声の持ち主であり、その音域の広さには驚かされるものがある。これらの曲はどれもハードで生々しく、キャッチーで、素晴らしいギターとドラムのサウンドを持っています。「Outshined」は、おそらく私が最も好きなSoundgardenの曲です。ロックファンはこれを見逃すわけにはいかない：  1.Rusty Cage-5/5-Soundgardenの曲の中で最も好きな曲の1つです。クリス・コーネルも素晴らしい音を出しています。2.Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer！コーラスが最高にキャッチーです。3.Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-クリス・コーネルの叫び声は最高です。この曲は歌詞もいいし、ギターソロもいいし、マット・キャメロンのドラミングも際立っている。4.ジーザス・クライスト・ポーズ-5/5-この曲が何について歌っているのかわからないが、キック・アズ・ア・ポーズだ。音楽（とにかくギターとドラム）が本当にいいんです。5.Face Pollution-5/5-素晴らしいタイトル、曲はOKです。このアルバムの中で一番短い曲です。幻覚かもしれませんが、最後にメイナード・ジェイムズ・キーナン（Toolのリードシンガー）がちんぷんかんぷんなことを歌っているように聞こえます。6.Somewhere-5/5-このアルバムで最も調和のとれた曲だが、まだ「叫び」がある。7.Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-冒頭、男が動物の名前とその言葉を挙げ、最後に「The devil sounds like this」と述べ、コーネルが歌い始めるところが最高です。歌詞も本当にいい。8.Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-音楽は良いが、ボーカルが音楽の影に隠れてしまっているので4/5 9. Mind Riot-5/5-どの曲よりも叫びが少ない。コーネルはこの曲を完璧に歌いこなしています。10.Drawing Flies-5/5-歌詞が良い。11.Holy Water-5/5-(ノーコメント) 12.New Damage-5/5-アルバムの中で最高の1曲です。アルバムの出番が多い！  
5,私のお気に入りの曲は、エイミー・リーがピアノの前に座り、走り回ったりしていないときのもので、彼女の音は*素晴らしい*です。
4,"このCDを最初に聴いたのは職場の音響システムでしたが、これは正当な評価ではありません。  私は軽い感銘を受けただけで、""最高の凡作 ""という主旨の酷評を提出しようと思っていました。  しかし、家に持ち帰り、本物のサウンドシステムで聴いてみたのです。なんと！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！？  ジェラルドは、ソロ・アーティストとしてよりも、プレミア・セッション・マンとして活躍する方がはるかに有望だと私は考えているが、GRPとの2作目となるこの作品は、『Groovology』よりもはるかに優れている。前作は、ミュージシャンズ・ブロックに苦しむアーティストを象徴するようなものであった。「ジェフ・ローバーやジョージ・デュークの協力を得て、クリエイティビティは最高潮に達し、何度でも楽しめる素晴らしいプロジェクトに仕上がった。  アレンジはタイトで、新鮮な解釈、Jr.ウォーカーへの素敵なオード、そしてローバーとのコラボレーションによる素敵な曲もある。  正直なところ、ジェラルド・オルブライトのプロジェクトにこれほど感動したのは久しぶりだ。  彼はようやく自分のペースを取り戻したようで、これほど嬉しいことはない。  ニイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイイス、ジェラルド！！！"
4,1993年に発売されたDark Tranquilityの『Skydancer』は、今でも傑作として語り継がれています。  At the Gates、In Flames、Carcass、Death、Edge of Sanityとともに、Dark Tranquilityはメロディック・デス・メタルというジャンルを作り上げました。優れたメロディック・デス・アルバムに期待されるものはすべてここにある。アグレッシブなサウンドにアコースティックなパート、緻密なコンセプト、そして唸るようなボーカルが並列している。  Mikeal Stanneは、怒ったような声と平和的な声を同時に出せる唯一のボーカリストの一人だ。  女性ボーカルを使ったエフェクトなど、多くのアイディアも時代を先取りしている。オリジナルではあるが、プロダクションがあまりうまくいっていないのと、まだ彼らのスキルがピークに達していなかったので、満点評価はできないが。
2,この録音の品質には満足していない。  マクガリーグ夫妻はとにかく素晴らしいのですが、このアルバムのサウンドエンジニアリングは最悪です。  最初と最後のカットは問題なさそうだが、その間のカットは重厚な楽器にひどく上書きされ、すべてが雑音にしか見えない！  特にピアノがうるさすぎて、歌が意味不明になってしまった。  また、「ダブリンの鐘」（史上最高のクリスマス音楽）の中から、すでに大好きな曲を何曲か姉妹で作り直したのもいただけない。  私が待ち望んでいた輝きは、この作品にはありません。
5,"スリーター・キニーの『Dig Me Out』は、1990年代最高のレコードのひとつであるだけでなく、90年代の音楽の極めて重要な断面である-一方では自立を目指すスピットファイアーの女性たちが、他方では傷つきやすい土臭いタイプたちが粉骨砕身する。  パンクの激しさを見事に音で表現していますが、それはパンクの激しさに親密さと儚さが混ざったものです。  タイトル曲でコーリン・タッカーが彼女を掘るように「私の体から、私の皮膚から」と叫ぶとき、あなたは確かに傷ついたように感じるが、それはこのようなセリフの人間性とその制作の正直さにある。  切ない三角関係が崩れる ""One More Hour""、激しい ""Words and Guitar""、セクシーな ""Dance Song '97 ""など、曲はそこから先も衰えることがない。  これは、非常に優れたバンドが、ロックの心臓を狙うことによってロックの土台を転覆させる能力を持つ偉大なバンドになった瞬間である。"
5,彼の曲は本当に素晴らしく、一緒に歌いやすい。
4,スティーリー・ダンのコンピレーションは何度も出ているが、最新の「ディフィニティブ・コレクション」は、バンドの代表作を1枚のディスクに収めたものだ。また、完全性を期すため、「再結成」CDからも1曲ずつ収録しています。Do It Again」、「Reelin' In The Years」、「Rikki Don't Lose That Number」、「Black Friday」、「Deacon Blues」、「Peg」、「Hey Nineteen」といったスティール・クラシックはすべてここに収録されており、当時と同様に新鮮でユニークなサウンドとなっている。このコレクションは、曲数の多さと価格の安さから、初心者のダン・ファンにとって理想的なスタート地点であるが、この決定版コレクションには、1曲だけ、永遠の名曲「Josie」が抜けていることに注意しなければならない。確かに、このCDは78分近い楽曲を限界まで詰め込んだもので、最初から最後まで素晴らしい出来栄えです。しかし、「Josie」を収録し、例えば「Dirty Work」のようなトラックを削除すれば（筆者の意見）、このコレクションは全体としてより強く、まとまりのあるものになっただろう。さすがにこの曲集の編集に関わっただけあって、バンドはこうしたかったのだろう。  これを除けば、スティーリー・ダンの『ディフィニティブ・コレクション』は、このバンドを知るための格好の入門書である。より包括的な概要を知りたい方は、ここに収録されている全曲（「再結成」2曲を除く）＋αを収録した2枚組コンピレーション『Show Biz Kids』をご覧ください。
5,もしあなたがT-Bone Walkerのスタイルが好きなら、あるいはRonnieとDukeが長年にわたって私たちを楽しませてくれた純粋なT-Boneのリックに垂涎するなら、「Two Bones and a Pick」は8分間にわたる純粋なジャンプブルース・ギターの天国だ。  私は何時間でも聴き続けられる。  白人の2人組がジャンプ・ブルース・ギターを弾きこなすとしたら、この2人だろう。  T-Boneはチェシャ猫みたいにニヤニヤしている。
4,まず最初に、私は少なくとも60分の演奏時間を与え、長いギターソロをカットしないアーティストやレーベルにとても感謝しています。  ロニー・アールとデュークが70分以上にわたって独創的なデュエットでギタージャムを繰り広げるこのCDは、この点では確かに優れている。  このCDは5つ星に近いが、クラシックでもなく、画期的でもない。しかし、この点に真剣に反対するレビュアーもいると思う。  異なるスタイルでお互いを引き立て合う2人のプロによる、とても良い音楽です。  強くお勧めします。
4,Cannibal Oxを初めて聴いたのは、去年の冬、友人のスノーボードビデオの中でした。彼はIron GalaxyというCDの1曲目、そして僕の中では最高の曲のイントロを担当したんだ。基本的にそれがきっかけでこのグループに興味を持ち、後に彼らが僕の大好きなグループの一つであるカンパニー・フローと相関関係があることを知ったんだ。  彼らのCDを手に入れたが、それを聴くのは本当に長い間待った。このCDはかなり未来的で、Deltron 3030（私のお気に入りの1つ）のような抽象的なものですが、歌詞の内容はDeltronには遠く及びません（一体、何が？もしあなたがファンでないなら、このCDを手に取るのは最良のアイデアではないかもしれません。このCDには、B-Boys Alpha、Atom、そして私のお気に入りの一つであるThe Battle For Asgardなど、とても良い曲があります。しかし、このCDに収録されているいくつかの曲は、アルバム全体を悪くしていると思います。例えば、このCDに収録されている曲のいくつかは、ストレスラップとペインキラーズという弱いプロダクションです。そして、スタジオで韻を踏んだ言葉を思いつき、その通りにしたような曲もある。  基本的にこのCDは80％が天才なので、4つ星で十分です。正直なところ、もっといいものができたと思うので、3.5つにしたいところです。
1,Nellyは、私が今まで聞いた中で最も迷惑な無知なラッパーの一人です。最初のアルバムでは彼を褒めたが、彼は下り坂に入り、「素晴らしいクラブビートを作ることができるが、その上にバブルガムのような歌詞を書く」傾向を始めた。これが悲しいことに、すべてのChingysやLil Johnsなどを生み出してしまった。彼は自分の音楽に何の中身も加えていないのに、MTVのおかげで何百万も売れている。本物の音楽を作る本物のアーティストにお金を貯めればいいんだ。
1,THE CARSは最も過大評価されているバンドの1つであるに違いない。彼らはまともな曲をBye Bye Loveの1曲しか作っていない。それ以外の曲は、ただひたすら最悪だ。つまり、なぜ人々はクイーン、カーズ、ACDC、ビートルズ、ストーン、フー、スティーブ・ミラー、ボストンといった最低のバンドを愛するのだろう？良いバンドはダイア・ストレイツ、フォーリナー、ガンズ・アンド・ローズ、ニルヴァーナ、グリーン・デイ、エアロスミス、ジョー・ウォルシュでなければならないのです。このひどいコンピレーションに対する5つ星のレビュアーは読まないでください。代わりにニルヴァーナのもっといいアルバムを買ってきてくれ。Ps the cars suck
2,ポールは何を考えているんだ？ミックステープではリリック的にとても良いし、あなたの心を正しく理解することもできるのに、このCDでは何の努力もしていない！OK 最初の私はStill Tippinから取ったプレイヤ、Internet goiong nutz from Still Tippinはすべて陳腐な流れの繰り返し用語だがいくつかの曲は良かった sittin sidewaysは発売の1年ほど前にすでに私の頭の中に叩き込まれていたので何が残ったのか？このCDの代わりにChick MagnetやHow to be a playerを再リリースすべきだった！Big Ballinはかなり良かったが、それでもこのCDは聴く価値がない。Paul Wallのミックステープを買えば、良い曲ばかりでミックステープはもっと良いよ！彼は新しいフローが必要だね！本当だよ！ああ、このトラックリスト、少なくとも僕が買ったCDでは正しくないね。
1,ワックライムで耳穴から吐き出す。それくらいポール・ウォールはワックなのです。お腹いっぱい食べてポール・ウォールを聴いた後、私の夕食は耳から吐き出されるのです。このようなゴミのようなラッパーが電波をゴミで汚染することに、私はすこぶるうんざりしている。この男はモス・デフのCDを叩いても歌詞の内容を知らないだろう。
2,キム・ウォーターズは最も親切な人の一人ですが、それでも私は、彼の将来のためになるような率直な批評をすることを妨げるものではありません。このプロジェクトにかなりの時間が費やされたことはわかるが、あのドラムマシンがこの努力を台無しにしている。この音楽は、あのドラムマシンのせいで機械的でイライラして、聴くのに耐えられないんだ。ドラムマシンは音を安っぽくするので、このCDを本当の音楽愛好家、特にまともなオーディオシステムを持つ人に薦めることはできない。唯一、本物の音楽のように聞こえるのは「Daydreaming」だが、これも他の曲よりは少ないものの、あの機械的なドラムマシンによって多少損なわれている。キム、これからは本物のドラムを使ってくれ。あなたは素晴らしい才能を持ったベテランのスムースジャズアーティストなのに、ドラムマシーンに頼って制作を安っぽくしている。あのマシンは機械的な音で、自発性がない。あなたはアーティストとして、それに頼らざるを得ないほど前進しているのです。本物のドラマーに頼めば少し高くつくかもしれないが、あなたは本物のドラムが不可欠なクラスなのだ。
5,これは素晴らしいCDです。  踊っても、歌っても、ドライブしても楽しいです。  カントリーミュージックが好きかどうかは関係なく、キース・アーバンの音楽を楽しむことができるのです。  CDよりもっといいのは、彼のライブショーです。  チケット代を払う価値は十分にあり、最高のコンサートのひとつです。
5,正直なところ、2004年にコンサートに連れて行ってもらうまで、クリスのことは全く知らなかったんです。その夜演奏したすべてのバンドの中で、クリスは本当に私の心を捉えたと認めざるを得ない。  このCDは礼拝的な曲とロックな曲のバランスがとれている。特に「Forever」では、クリスのリード・ギタリストがU2の「the Edge」に似たような音を出していて、曲に素晴らしい次元を与えています。  クリスが歌う「How Great is Our God」を聴くまでは、ワーシップソングを十分に理解したことがなかったが、このCDでは全く新しい視点を与えてくれ、非常に効果的に表現されている。  これらの曲以外にも、「Indescribable」の素晴らしいエネルギッシュなバージョンや、「Famous One」「Raise Up Holy Hands」などの人気曲が収録されており、このCDはマストバイとなっている。  あのコンサートの時から、あのツアーのCDを発売してほしいと願っていたのですが、その願いが叶いました（想像してみてください）。   2/06追記：ミシガン州サギノーで8人でクリスに再会し、数日後、人生で最高のワーシップ体験だったということになりました。  CDでその場にいるような体験を完全に再現するのは難しいですが、正しい視点で見れば、かなり近づけることができます。  クリスが現在行っているマット・レッドマンとスピーカーのルイ・ギグリオとのツアーにぜひ足を運んでみてください。
5,"正直なところ、Relient Kを実際に楽しむにはしばらく時間がかかりました。彼らの音楽はとても一般的で、歌詞は安っぽいと思っていたのです。でも、このアルバムですべてが変わりました。Matt Thiessenはとても賢いリリシストで、私の中の言葉の魔術師を喜ばせるのに十分な言葉遊びを使いながら、神や他人との関係についてより深く考えさせてくれる。  バンドはこのアルバムで標準的なポップパンク・リフに固執しているが、このアルバムではよりスムーズなスピードと楽器の切り替えを使用していると思う。例を挙げよう：Be My Escapeは、ギターの絶叫と速いビートで始まり、詩の部分ではキーボード、ボーカル、軽いドラムに柔らかくなり、ブリッジとコーラスではロック調に戻り、最後は感動的にスローダウンする。他にも同じように変化する曲が何曲かあります。  リリックでは、Be My Escape (But the beauty of grace is that makes life not fair), Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet (I move you, but you just wouldn't budge, I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge), When I Go Down (When I go down, I'll lift my eyes to You, but I won't look too far, 'Cause You'll be there with open arms, to lift me up again...) が本当に楽しかったですね。このアルバムはなんと美しい終わり方だろう！  音楽的には、多くの曲が際立っています。High of 75は、アコースティックギターで始まり、サビではドラムループが入るなど、最もオリジナルな曲でしょう。他にも、Who I am Hates Who I've Beenや、素晴らしいボーカルとクールなスクリームが融合したLife After Death & Taxesなどがハイライトです！  レリエントKは私をファンにしてくれた。このアルバムを買えば、あなたも同じようにファンになってくれるだろう。"
1,私は彼らを2回見ました。1回はsix feet underのオープニングで、もう1回はstrapping young ladのオープニングでした。そして2回とも、彼らの音を聞かないようにするために、頭をコンクリートで殴りたくなったよ。ヘビーなパートもメロディックなパートも眠くなるようなものだ。unearthやopethになろうとするのはやめて、彼らのように良い音楽を作るんだ。
2,アリソン・クラウスを聴いたことがある人なら、最高のものを聴いたと思います。  ロンダのアレンジと歌声は十分だったが、特別なことはなく、このCDをもう一度聴くことはないだろう。
1,このミュージシャンは、もしそう呼べるのなら、恥をかくべきです。  言いたいことがあるのなら、こんな下品な言葉を使わず、自分の体の一部について話すのをやめれば、もっと多くの人が耳を傾けるはずです。  私はこれを買わないし、私の子供たちも買わないだろう。  反吐が出る
2,ここ数ヶ月、Devendraの他の作品にすっかりハマってしまい、このアルバムを初めて手にした時は、他の作品と同じような小さな美味しい驚きを期待していました。  しかし、その期待は裏切られた。  このアルバムには、バンハートの他のアルバムのように、エネルギーが伝わってこないのだ。  また、このアルバムに収録されている曲と同じ曲の他のバージョンは、ジャナ・ハンターとのスプリット・アルバムですでにたくさん聴いているが、そちらの方がずっと退屈で、他の録音にあるような感情を引き継いでいないように感じられた。  とはいえ、Devendraは素晴らしいとは言えないまでも、いつもまったく問題ない。  彼の声はとても魅力的だし、一般的にとても才能のあるソングライターだと思う。    では、教訓は？  もし、このレコーディングに参加できなかったとしても、まだDevendraをあきらめないでください。  ジャナ・ハンターとのスプリット・アルバム『Cripple Crow』や、もう少し生々しい音楽が好きなら、個人的には『The Black Babies』がお薦めです。
5,"トム・ブラクストンの演奏を、彼のアルママダーであるダンバー中学校（当時はダンバー高校）で、非常に幸せな観客のために見る機会がありました。""ジュリアンズ・スマイル ""と ""バウンス ""の演奏は素晴らしく、滑らかで新鮮なサウンドです。機会があれば彼のライブを見て、とにかくCDを買ってください。"
1,Drew's Famous Party Musicは冗談のようなものです。このCDを購入する前に、レビューを読んでおけばよかったと思います。この3週間で、主催するパーティーのために70年代、80年代、90年代の素晴らしい音楽を求めて、おそらく8～9枚のコンピレーションCDを注文しました。他のCDのレビューも読みましたが、Whoomp there it isとLove Trainを見つけた時の興奮で、このCDのレビューをチェックしませんでした。このCDは、私が思っていたものとは全く違うものでした。信じてください、THIS IS NOT THE ONE、リストにすら載っていません。私は、Whoomp there it is、特にOjaysのLove Trainを探していたのです。私が手に入れたのはそれではなかった。ワクワクしながらWhoompを聴いたんだけど、何度も「これはおかしい」と言ったよ。この曲には何かが欠けているように聞こえるんだ。それでLove Trainを聴いてみたら、すぐにオージェイズの歌ではないことがわかったんです。オリジナル・アーティストが誰も歌っていないことがわかったのです。これはひどい誤魔化しです。私はとてもがっかりしました！パーティーで流す前にCDを聴いておいてよかった。私ならゾッとするところでした。星を1つ減らして、返金してもらえたらいいのに。どうか、どうか、お金を無駄にしないでください
5,このアルバムは、ラブ・フェローシップ・クワイアの壮大な歌声とともに、アーティストの驚くべき仕事をさらに引き立てています！私はこのアンサンブルの作品を聴くとき、いつも耳を傾けています。なぜなら、彼らが常に「Bring it」してくれることを知っているからです！  神のご加護を!
5,"terminal heaven's rockはいい曲ですね！Sick VibrationとOVER AMPもかなり良いですね。OVER AMPはいつもの変な英語の歌詞です。""She lives by fake slide away ""です。  これを手に入れることを強くお勧めします。12分8秒の純粋な良い曲です。CDプレーヤーに入れるたびに、少なくとも3回は聴くことになるだろう。"
5,どの曲も好きです。  他の多くのバンドと違って、このCDは前のCDと同じように良いものです
2,このアルバムに収録されている曲はどれもとても良いのですが、しかし、標準には達していません。サブライムはこのアルバムよりもずっと良いバンドです。カジュアルなファンなら、まずこれを推薦しません。代わりに、「40 oz. to Freedom」を推薦します。個人的にサブライムのアルバムはこれが一番好きです。すべてのヒット曲が入っていないかもしれませんが、Robbin the hoodやセルフタイトルよりずっと良いです。素晴らしい曲、ひどいコンパイルメント
2,このCDを聴いたとき、実はいくつかの曲でグロリア・エスタファンが歌っているのを期待していたんです。  彼女のために書かれたような曲もある。  ワイルド・カード』にはいくつかいい曲がある。  タイトル曲はまあまあ。  MoonlightとKing Of Heartsはもっといい。  リプトンズの最後の良いCDは『Weekend In Monaco』だ。  人員、場所、レーベルが変わっても、ラスの音楽にはあまりいい影響がないことが証明された。  彼はもうお金を稼いだので、いろいろなアイデアを試すことができます。  ワイルド・カード』は私の中では負け組だが、少なくとも『ブレイブ・ニュー・ワールド』よりはましだ。
5,ニューポルノグラファーズの素晴らしいデビューアルバムから3年後にリリースされたアルバムです。このアルバムも似たようなものだが、前作よりも艶やかな雰囲気がある。このアルバムは間違いなくより洗練されている。アルバム全体を通して素晴らしいシンセサイザーとパーカッションが使われています。エレクトリック・ヴァージョンは、楽しくて聴きやすい、ハングリーなフックが詰まった、インディー・ロックの古典的な謙虚さに溢れた作品です。
5,ガンズ・アンド・ローゼズは私が昔から好きなバンドの一つなので、このアルバムは少し残念だ。誤解しないでほしいのは、ここに収録されているほぼ全ての曲が素晴らしいということで、もっとふさわしい曲が他にあるということだ。しかし、レコード会社がベスト盤を出すことはあり得ない。レコード会社がこれをリリースした唯一の理由は、アクセルが『チャイニーズ・ドモクラシー』にあまりにも長い時間をかけていたため、お金が欲しくなり、これをリリースし、それなりのお金を集めたからだ。このアルバムは、ガンズ・アンド・ローゼズが史上最大かつ最高のロックバンドであることを、本物のロックファンがすでに知っていることを確認するのに良い仕事をしたんだ。彼らはロックンロールが救世主を必要としていた時期にやってきて、まさにその通り、音楽に魂と姿勢を取り戻した。ノベンバー・レイン、ウェルカム・トゥ・ザ・ジャングル、パラダイス・シティのような曲は、バンドの長所を本当に強調しており、このアルバムは新しいファンにとって良い出発点となっている。スパゲッティ・インシデントを除けば、どのアルバムも天才的な出来なので、全作品を購入することをお勧めします（ただし、スパゲッティ・インシデントは単なるカバーアルバムでした）。  このアルバムには、Mr.Brownstone、It Ain't easy、Nighttrain、Rocket Queenなどの名曲が収録されておらず、その点については怒りを覚えます。また、Sympathy for the devilのカバーは一体どうやってここに収録されたのだろう。それは単にひどいもので、おそらくGuns N' Roses史上最悪の曲だろう。だから、もしあなたがすでに大ファンで、すべてのアルバムを持っているなら、これは買わないで、中国の民主主義にお金を貯めましょう。マダガスカル、ブルース、リアド、ベドウィンのような曲は僕のアクセルに対する信念を再確認させてくれたし、もしこのアルバムが日の目を見ることになったら、きっと大きなものになると思う。また、Rose hill Driveというバンドもチェックしてみてください。彼らは今最もエキサイティングなバンドで、ロックンロールの真のファンなら誰でも楽しめるはずです。
5,ホワイトノイズ的なCDがいい。  ただの雨の音。  まあ、私にはベーコンを炒めたような音に聞こえるのは認めざるを得ないが。  でもね。  私の赤ちゃんは2人ともこのCDでぐっすり眠っています。  ママ友にも勧めています。  我が家では欠かせない存在です
2,このレコードはロベン・フォードの最高の状態ではなく、刺激のない演奏と歌、そして歌詞は本当にレベルが低く、全く良いレコードとは言えませんね。
4,このCDはまあまあです。初期のJBバラードが中心です。このCDは、当時のブラック・オーディオのために行われたチットリン・サーキットの演奏の良いアイデアを提供し、観客の反応も適切である。この曲のハイライトは、quot;Lost Someone&quot;の拡張バージョンで、quot;Please Please Please;につながっている。しかし、JBを一躍有名にしたアップテンポな曲も収録されているので、全体的にはVol.2の方が良い。
5,なるほど、KSはConor Oberstと声が似ているんですね。だから何？大したことないだろ？Blink-182、Good Charlotte、Simple Planはどれも全く同じに聞こえるし、5つ星の評価を受けているんだ！いい加減にしとけよ。それに、声は似ていても、音楽はだいぶ違うんだから、音も違う。オーケストラやアコーディオンや金管楽器や木管楽器まで使っているし...まあ、それはそれとして。でも、これは普通のぼったくりフォーク／インディーズバンドとは違うんだ。それと、たぶん彼の声は自然にコナー・オバーストのように聞こえるのだろう。それはどうしようもないことだ。An Angleはとても才能があり、様々なサウンドを試している。僕はこのCDを時々ポチるんだけど、お気に入りではないけど、とても良いよ！ブライトアイズのパクリだと思わずに、このCDを聴いてみてください、だってそれは違うんですから。
5,ビースティ・ボーイズに出会ったのは、仲間からの漠然とした勧めによるもので、何を期待していいのかわからないままでした。最初はlicense to illを聴きましたが、それなりに楽しめましたが、薦められたものとは違いました。その後、check your headに移り、pass the micやso what cha want、live at pjsなどの曲に驚かされました。それ以来、私はこのアルバムに完全に打ちのめされています。パンクロック、メタル、アシッドジャズ、ファンク、ワールドビート、ヒップホップを同じアルバム、時には同じ曲の中で融合させたアルバムは他にないと思う。そして、それは素晴らしいミックスになっている。  このアルバムは、スタイルが見事にミックスされているだけでなく、ボーカルが他の楽器の伴奏になるように少しミックスダウンされ、シンセが音楽にシームレスに溶け込み、トライバルビートがいくつかの素晴らしい曲の土台となるように、鮮明に制作されています。獣人たちは、彼らが試みるそれぞれの曲のスタイルに合わせて録音し、ミックスすることに成功している。  そして、彼らは多くのことを試みている。The Update」や「Futterman's Rule」のような曲は、サイケデリック・ファンク・フェストで、バックボーンとしてトライバル・ワールド・ビート、いたるところにシンセサイザー、ファンキーなギターリックがあり、私は彼らを愛さずにはいられなかった。Sabotage」や「Heart Attack Man」のような曲は、素晴らしいパンクメタルリフと速いヘビーなドラムビートで、ペースを変えることができます。民謡のようなフルートのリフを、ファンキーなビート、狂ったスクラッチ、狂った歌詞でヒップホップの世界に持ち込めるのはビースティーズの他に誰がいるだろうか。誰もいないよ、それこそ。  このアルバムは、ファンク、パンク、ヒップホップ、ジャズが好きな人にお薦めです。  私のお勧めはThe Update、Futterman's Rule、Flute Loop、Sure Shot、Heart Attack Man、B-Boys making with the Freak Freakです。  楽しむ
5,恥ずかしながら、大人の私でも、このCDの音楽は大好きです！子供たちは車の中や小さなCDプレーヤーで聴いています。子供たちは年長（8歳と11歳）なので、すでに下位のタイムテーブルを知っていますが、どの曲も素晴らしいので、とにかく聴いて、今ではすべての数字を覚えています。(長いCDで、他の子供向け音楽より断然長いのですが、歌に沿ったストーリーがついています。まるでテープで本を聴いているようです。バーニーとスポンジボブ（どちらも子供の脳にはあまり効きませんでした）を何年も聴いてきたので、私も一緒に歌えるものがあってとてもうれしいです。
5,このアルバムの素晴らしさを何年も忘れていたので、アマゾンで見つけたときは感激しました！しかし、このアルバムは私のカーステレオにぴったりで、通勤時間があっという間に過ぎ、昔よりさらに良い音になっています！ありがとうございました。
1,トロイ......なぜこれに自分の名前を入れたんだ。  このCDには1曲だけ良い曲が入っていて、それが長くて短い理由だ。  私はプレスする価値のないCDについて話す時間の束を無駄にするつもりはない。ところで、グループは大佐のコンラッドと一緒の方が良かった（Ehh Hehhh！  I AM DSGB！
5,OutKastが発売されて少し経ちますが、このアルバムで私は真のファンになり、彼らの創造性を認識しました。  このアルバムはクランクしていて、エキサイティングで、見事にまとまっていて、ヒップホップの最良の例だと思う。  OutKastは先駆者でありながら、とても素晴らしいので、今ではほとんどメインストリームになってしまいましたが、良い意味で（OutKastはアンチBlack Eyed Peasです、笑）。  Stankoniaは、ヒップホップをより高いレベルに引き上げるために変化し続けるOutKastの形をそのまま引き継いでいる。  Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik、ATLiens、Aqueminiを聴いたことがある人なら、このアルバムで予想外のものを期待することができると思うだろう。  Stankonia』は、優れたヒップホップは、ダンスやグルーヴと同時に考えさせることができるという証拠として、私がいつもディベートで挙げるヒップホップのアルバムのひとつです。  アンドレ3000はとても政治的だが、注意を払わないと彼のメッセージを見逃してしまう。  非常にお勧めのLPです。楽しくてクランキーで、社会的・政治的なコメントが隠されている。ずっと好きなアルバムの1つです。
1,"この種の音楽は、脳にできた水ぶくれのようなものです。  取り除くことはできないし、いらいらする。  そう、4年前のこのCDがいまだに流されている時点で、ほとんどのFMラジオはこれが問題なのだ。  そして、""This Love ""の曲は、言葉の間にポーズをとるので、イライラすることこの上ない。  モロン5は、グウェン・ステファニーやブラック・アイズ・ピーズと並んで、最も迷惑な売れっ子アーティストにランクされている。"
1,ナイン・インチ・ネイルズはこのCDの中で唯一聴く価値のあるバンドだ、このサウンドトラックは糞だ。
1,"私を愚かな嫌われ者だと切り捨てる前に、私の話を聞いてください。私は個人的に、オマリオンはそれなりに良いシンガーであり、とんでもなく素晴らしいダンサーだと思うが、神に誓って、これは私が今まで聴いた中で最悪のアルバムの1つである。   このアルバムには感情的な深みが全くなく、オリジナリティのかけらも見当たらないし、もっと重要なのはサウンドだ。愛とセックスと平均以下のクラブバンガーはあるが、それ以上のものはない！このほとんど価値のないガラクタを聴くためにわざわざ時間を割いたという事実以上に私を悩ませるものがあるとすれば、それは、オマリオンのファンやグルーピーが、苦労して稼いだお金を投じてこのアルバムをビルボードアルバムトップ200の1位に押し上げるほど正気ではなかったということだ！これは、現在の音楽水準について多くのことを物語っています。  しかし、このアルバムには、オマリオンの真の可能性を示す明るいスポットもある。「オマリオンのヒット曲 ""O ""は、独創的でない題材にかかわらず、彼の滑らかなボーカルを聴けば、どんな女の子もゆっくりと溶けていくことでしょう。また、""Touch ""は、キャッチーでシンプルなダンサブル・ビートとスムーズなボーカル、そしてオリジナルではない題材（この場合、欲望とセックス）を組み合わせた、もう一つのハイライトです。しかし、クラブ・バンガーの多くは、あまり中身を必要としないので、この曲の場合は大した問題ではないだろう。個人的には、この曲はもっと成功してもいいと思っている。そうそう、「Growing Pains」も忘れてはいけない。この曲は、オマリオンがかつてヒットしたR&B/ポップグループB2Kとの破局を説明する感動的な曲だ！  しかし、3曲の素晴らしいトラックと1曲のアベレージ以上のトラック（Touch）は、このアルバムを崩壊から救うには十分ではありません。このアルバムの残りの部分は（軽く言ってしまえば）全くのゴミで、少なくとも1/2の頭脳を持つ人なら、このアルバムが本当に悲劇的であることに気がつくだろう。Omarionは、誰もが彼のことを真剣に考え始める前に、自分の音楽にもっと考えと中身を入れる必要があります！オマリオンが2枚目のソロアルバムを作ることになったら、もっと良くなることを願うが、それまでは、絶対にこのアルバムをスキップしてほしい！   注：なぜ私がこのようなひどいアルバムをわざわざレビューしたのか、不思議に思っている人がいるかもしれませんが、それは、誰も、つまり「誰でも」、このような悪質で精神的に堕落したバブルガムの駄作で苦労して稼いだお金を浪費してはいけないと思うからです。それだけでなく、オマリオンは彼のアルバムが得た成功に値しない。ソロ・キャリアという点では、オマリオンよりもっと成功に値するアーティストがたくさんいるのは明らかだ。"
