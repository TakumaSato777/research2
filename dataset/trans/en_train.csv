2,"This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed."
1,"This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber"
1,"Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.  The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!"
1,"Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all"
1,"I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again"
1,"When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation"
2,This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: &quot;Lisa de los ojos azules&quot;. I wouldn't buy this CD without that song
1,"I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.  There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like ""Swim"": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire."" Or the artistic suicide of the last track, ""X-Girlfriend"", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between ""Machinehead"" and ""Glycerine."" The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building."
1,There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother
2,"I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.   My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that ""very best of"" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.   Some reviewers are saying there's ""heart and soul"" all over this album?  That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.   As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very ""modern"" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.  Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new ""very best of"" collection)"
1,Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..

1,"If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks"
2,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies."
2,"I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.    I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much ""pop"", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about ""different"", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.    Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called ""keyboard solo"" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.    I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.    Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from ""good"" to ""great"".    Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)"
1,"Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers"
2,"Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.   Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (""Encore"", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).   D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here"
1,"After hearing ""I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)"" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa"
1,"First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable   This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing"
1,I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back
2,"This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves."
1,"Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.   "
1,"If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately"
1,"This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping"
2,"I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it.."
2,"Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.  Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song ""I Fought Piranhas"".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times."
1,"There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. ""Songs of Judy Garland"" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what ""look"" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of ""makeover"". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to ""Liza Minnelli"" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't"
1,"I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime"
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever."
2,"This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness"
2,"Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums"

2,"The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.   Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like ""Terribile lo Sento"", and ""Orribile lo Scempio"", ""GI'otraggi"" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic. "
2,"Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever"" on msn"

1,"I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either"
1,"i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's. this band was one of them. while yes, they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy, they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song.  i think they should have just did a ""da hui"" single with ""the noose"" and maybe ""cant get my head around you"" on it. this sucks really bad. it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album!! if you must hear, download or borrow.  please guys. quit or make good music. its pretty pathetic hearing ""hit that"" next to the godawful creed and nickelbland!!  so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by TSOL and The Damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this...a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless"
2,"As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.  Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.  Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit..."

The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what ""A Hard Days' Night"" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' ""Head"" than I was of ""A Hard Days' Night"".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to ""From Justin to Kelly"""
1,"Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television"
1,"This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2"" mark the sound of the ""rock water"" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this"
2,NOTHING NEW HERE.  I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton.  This cd is dull.  Suffering from Patton overexposure.  Maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album (Like Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizons)  rather than dozens of merely adequate ones
2,"When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style"
1,"on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went.  to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery.  if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. ""death letter"" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.  the rest is a waste of time.  the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd.  these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated.  go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain"
2,"There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy."
2,"i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though"
1,"The worst Christmas album I ever heard.  I just bought it, played it once, and will NEVER play it again"
1,"I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series"
1,Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere
1,"This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them"
1,"I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!"
1,"To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song"
2,"Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.   Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.  Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference"
1,Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money
1,"I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead"
1,"This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin"
1,"This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this"
1,"This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out"
2,"At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd.  At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.  To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.    If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.    I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, ""If the South Woulda Won,"" which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song. "
2,"I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it"
1,This never should've been pressed.  They should've taken the mix and thrown it out.  DO NOT BUY!!
2,"The singing is terrible on ""Fly Me To The Moon"".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings ""all I worship and adore"", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.  The rest of the pieces sound fine"
5,"I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang."
5,if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly mayby. Tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;V.I.C.E&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have
5,"I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like. My favorite ones are in order; Erotica Ray of Light Beautiful Stranger The power of goodbye Deeper and Deeper The prodution is excellent and I love the vocals. If your new to Madonna, my opinion would be to start here. But a true fan can give me lessons."
4,"As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a ""must-have"" for all Iron Butterfly fans"
5,"I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get ""Out Louder"", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought ""End of the World"" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.    THEN....I saw them PLAY.  You MUST see them PLAY!!  I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see them again!  It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's (""Out Louder"" and Scofield's ""A-Go-Go"" which they ""back"" him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this.  I'm like an ADDICT now!  I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house.  I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again.    I must say I like ""Out Louder"" and even ""A-Go-Go"" better than ""End of the World"", but only slightly.  It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few listens.  I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians"
1,"While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly ""note-for-note"" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close ""pop"" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey ""Masterpiece Theatre""-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week"
4,"I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else.   Though primarily focused on ""indie"" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies ""This Will Be Our Year"", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's ""Move On"",  Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic ""Sam Stone"", and the late Elliott Smith's ""A Distorted Reality..."", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the ""acoustic"" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's ""Everything's Ruined"" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of ""Date With The Night"" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause."
4,"It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s &quot;heydays,&quot; including the crank-it-up &quot;Gotcha&quot; (Starsky &amp; Hutch TV theme song) and soulful &quot;Shadows,&quot; among others.  I was disappointed more from &quot;Blow It Out&quot; wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott.  If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this.  Certainly worth $.."
1,"I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...  Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album ""Songs For Suicidal Lovers"", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: ""...aural film noir...delve into the dark side..."
5,"Prince's 1981 album CONTROVERSY is another classic album in his catalog. The title track is the standout immediately. This longer version than the single version features a prayer. The song is funky and effective. ""Sexuality"" is a great disco/funk number. ""Do Me, Baby"" is probably one of the sexiest songs he's ever done. This full length version is the one to hear. ""Private Joy"" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for ""Annie Christian"", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career"
1,"I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad."
2,"I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM.  However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over.  The entire album is pretty much ""blowing flowers out of your [rear end]"" types of songs. The title cut, ""Pictures"" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more.  It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote.  Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money"
4,"I have been ""making"" my kids listen to the music of TMBG for years, but I no longer have to ""make"" them listen.  My 6 and 7-year-olds actually ""want"" to listen to songs like ""No!,"" ""Clap Your Hands,"" and ""Four of Two.""  Although this is not TMBG's best CD (some say it is ""Flood""), this is my kid's favorite TMBG's CD"
5,"This CD will really grow on you. So listen to it several times before you make your final judgement. It is one of Van Morrison's best.  This CD appears to be almost Autobiographical at times. Especially STRANDED...JUST LIKE GRETA...THEY SOLD ME OUT. His Jazz background, his Irish background, his Blues  background...are all present on this CD."
2,"i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it"
1,"Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that ""hip-hop"" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45"
4,"Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three.  Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great.  These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade.  That's a good class to be in. "

1,"""With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. ""  ""Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit.""  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however"
5,"I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection."
1,"I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself. I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth"
1,"Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his ""fans"" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as ""music"".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. "

I liked to album, but I can hear hints of Supertramp's style in about half the songs here in different degrees.  ""Bad Day"" probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the ""Breakfast in America"" album to me.  Still the album is enjoyable though, especially if you did like Supertramp.  I get the Leo Sayer hook, but I think it's off a bit.  Leo never used that many keyboards"

5,"This music so so wonderful.  It is very high energy and fun.  The kids don't really care that this a ""jazz"" album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy.  Don't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as ""kids"" music, get them something you can both enjoy.  Our favorites are the ""Doodle"" song and ""Potato Chips.""  Worth every penny and then some"
5,This is one of the best kid CDs I've heard.  The songs are all catchy and fun to listen to.  It's a great intro to jazz
5,"This was They Might Be Giants first major label album.  It continued, and expanded upon, the sound they had established on their independant label albums.  It's probably TMBG's most popular album.  It features many classic TMBG songs, like ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", ""Istanbul"" and ""Particle Man"".  It's chock full of the catchy melodies and silly lyrics that we have come to expect from the Johns.  A must have for all They Might Be Giants fans"
5,Our 22 mo. old loves this music much more than the kiddy tunes that mom and dad can hardly bear to listen to.
5,"Hot Hot Heat's Make up the Breakdown is a follow-up of Knock Knock Knock. Personally, if you're a big Hot Hot Heat fan, this will be one of your most favorite albums. Each and every song is unique and has catchy beats that will make you want to dance. The first song Naked in the City Again is great.  The second song, No, Not Now, is a popular tune that you can't help but start movin'. Get in or Get out has some of the most rad keyboarding parts. Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing. Oh Goddamnit is such an amazing song, with very fun lyrics so you're bound to sing along. The next song Aveda keeps many of us wondering: Ex-Girlfriend or Hair Product? Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt. Although very different from Hot Hot Heat's normal songs, In Cairo, is also a great song and adds a fabulous ending to Make up the Breakdown. This cd will be in your stereo for hours on end. The songs are addicting so this album is definately worth it's money. "
5,"Wonderful harmony, great voices, beautiful music.  This group deserves to be better known and to be hugely successful"
1,"The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.  I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's ""trained"" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.  Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.  My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help"
5,"St. Elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [and at times wistful] voice of Cee-Low and thought-provoking lyrics. I enjoy the variety of styles [from the frentic ""Go-Go Gospel"" to the introspective ""Just a Thought""]. A must-have purchase"
2,"the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of ""classic"". I assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i cannot see it as a gothic ""club"" material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i cannot find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would  i was very dissapointed in the whole cd. listened to a few songs here and there, if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past."
4,"Having left my Gothic Club mix CD at home, I decided to buy this one. What hooked me first was the live recording of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" by Bauhaus, which is classic Goth music. Some of the bands I liked, some I didn't, but all in all this is a great CD. My favorite is ""Sheryl"" on the second CD. This is a great CD for chilling, dancing, or showing the uneducated masses what Goth music really is"
2,"Tony Yayo's ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon"" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as ""Tattle Teller,"" ""Curious,"" and ""Project Princess."" For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as ""Live By The Gun"" and ""Homicide,"" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for ""harder"" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment"
1,"I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul"
4,"This album is a masterpiece by a legend who, at 65 years old, topped the charts. Dylan is an extroadinary talent and seems to get even better with age. Every song is exceptional and showcases his great talent and songwriting ability"
5,"I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a ""rock"" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a ""good"" song while Alex's delivery makes it a ""great"" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to ""get together"" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just ""meant"" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of ""Smooth"" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job."
5,"An outstanding set of kid's music with folk scene stalwarts such as Arlo Guthrie, Taj Mahal and Tim O'Brien joined by bluegrassers Tim O'Brien and Rhonda Vincent and blues pickers Keb Mo, Guy Davis and Eric Bibb, as well as Americana-country types such as Rosie Flores... An impressive lineup, sure, but better still is the calibre of songwriting, and the actual kid friendliness of it all.  This is a really fun album!  Fun, as in, little kids might actually like it, and might even sing along if you played it for them.  Plenty of silly songs like ""Bling-Blang,"" ""Bananaphone"" and ""Bellybutton Song.""  Some songs are perky, like ""Red, Red Robin""; others are instructive, like ""Man Named All The Animals,"" and others still model assertiveness and communication skills, like Taj Mahal's excellent ""Don't You Push Me Down,"" in which various kids stick up for themselves in unpleasant situations.  I like this album a lot, and plan to play it for my kid for years to come"
5,"You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr"
5,"In 1975, Joe Jackson was tired of Motown Records controlling his childrens' careers. So he moved them over to Epic Records. The newly Christened ""Jacksons"" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few.  They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, ""The Jacksons"" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with ""Enjoy Yourself"" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic ""Style Of Life"". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that ""Good Times"" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat"
5,"I am 68 and a long time Stewart fan, this is one of his best.  Don't know what the problem is with the other reviewers"
5,"What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in ""Power, Corruption Lies"" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.    The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for ""Blue Monday"" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  ""Age of Consent"" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also ""the Village""  is a great track as well.  If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!  -- Ted Murena   "
5,This CD is great for the entire family. The songs are catchy and it's not a big deal if you're caught singing them around strangers!
2,"I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's"
5,"I enjoy the album still to this day. All the songs are good, but I listen a couple of songs more than others such as Hold On, You don't have to worry, Don't Go.  This is a great album, which I don't planning on selling or trading anytime soon. "
5,The Crusaders Sound Great on this Disc.The Music&amp;Arrangements work very well all the way thru.The Grooves&amp;Smoothness make this Recording very Complete.this Group has been Bad for so long
5,"If it has the name Edwin McCain on it, trust me its a great product to buy. The songs he writes are heart felt and true to every drop of ink used to write them with.."
1,"Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.  If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.  Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately"
1,"I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree"
5,"Carbon Leaf's sound continues to evolve, and the results are outstanding. The band says it has given up trying to ""define"" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: ""Block of Wood"" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while ""International Airport"" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.  The songs range from engaging (""Bright Lights,"" ""Love Loss Hope Repeat"") to anthemic (""Learn to Fly,"" ""Comfort"") to heartbreaking (""Block of Wood"") to humorous (""A Girl and Her Horse"") to profound (""The War Was in Color""). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album.   There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.  This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with ""Ganging Up on the Sun"" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with ""Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat."
4,One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not  get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If  you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one  great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to  seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley
5,"This soundtrack is excellent. There is not a single song that I skip when listening to the cd.  The mix of recent and older songs sung by familiar and unfamiliar artists is great.  Anita Nalick, Breathe (2a.m.) is worth the price of the album."
5,"I haven't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there's online piracy? But I have to own this.  Feinstein's voice is so pure and versatile; he is funny at a moment and the next, he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet. His performance is first class, and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert.  "
4,"I have maybe a hundred Christmas CDs (it's a hobby) but I think this is the only one with the ""Explicit Lyrics"" warning!  This is fore just for one song ""Here Comes Fatty Claus"" which featured a fairly prominent use of the ""sh*t"" word.  I have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the CD without that song. She loves it!  As for the CD... it's pretty good. Waters has managed to collect the best of campy Christmas songs, something unique as far as I'm aware.    But it's not just a novelty CD... the songs are good. This isn't intentional camp... it is sincere stuff with MAYBE the exception of the Tiny Time song. (One of my daughter's favorite, because it's well done."
1,"As if Fiddy Cent wasn't enough to make me break some bones, this horrible trend of Kayne West comes in. What is there to be said that hasn't been said? Nothing, really; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers. All I have to say is that I hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later.  Want good rap? Go for Tupac (R.I.P.) or Public Enemy"
1,"Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty.  &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember"
5,"Dan Zanes is great! My husband and I both enjoy listening to this as well as our 20 month old. Most of the other music CD's that we have for our son I find a little irritating after a bit of listening. Rocket Ship Beach is fun, family music! I highly recommend this to all ages"
1,"Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In ""Preacher's Daughter"" he even says ""A preacher's daugher so she had common sense."" I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then ""Pass Me Over"" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. ""Sista Big Bones"" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this"
4,"Bubble from Ab Fab sounds exactly like Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and others.  What a talent.  She needs her own Las Vegas Show.  She would be beyond great!  "
5,"Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars."
5,"I'm one of those people who didn't really *know* anything about Beck.  Oh sure I knew his hits - ""Loser"", ""Where It's At"", ""The New Pollution"" et al.  Just never really thought much about the guy.  Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go...""E Pro"" and ""Girl"".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.  During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with ""Earthquake Weather"".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being ""meh"" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!  The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the ""Hey! Guero!"" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!  DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem"
5,"""Alt-country"" would indeed be a limiting description,none-the-less an accurate point of reference,as this artist is obviously drawing from past Country musicians.But make no mistake,this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.I'm usually more inclined towards the Heavy than the twangy,but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings,and this woman can SING.One of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation"
5,"After the profound impact of the David Rawlings produced ""O.C.M.S.,"" to my music collection, my pre-order of ""Big Iron World"" came with pretty high expectations. I've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it doesn't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of ""Wagon Wheel,"" ""Big Iron World"" does pull some wonderfully surprising punches. Though he doesn't capture OCMS's live act at it's fullest (and who really could), Rawlings' production once again manages to maintain OCMS's authenticity and pushes their ""old-time"" music into the modern area, without a hint of the tacky, over-produced, artificial, gimmicks, heard on other neo-bluegrass records.   ""Big Iron World"" is not an album stuck in history, or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past. With ""Big Iron World,"" OCMS once again displays its own sound, pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward, while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of Woody Guthrie, the picking of Muleskinner and the late 60's albums of Dylan. Moreover, the songs of ""Big Iron World"" comprise a complete body of work. The pro-union, ""Union Maid"" and folksy ""James River Blues"" are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole, with each song complementing the next. As with all of OCMS's albums, ""Big Iron World"" is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age.  They have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres."
5,"by far, Picture This, is my favorite cd from the JB collection...have three copies...one for the home, one for the car, and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts! Been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997...despite our daily hectic schedules, his music always brings us back to a place that is calm, relaxing & peaceful...now that we have small children, they are even accustomed to listening his music, which makes bedtime even sweeter! :)"
1,"You got to be kidding me right? People actually giving this album 5 stars. Wow people are so blind it isn't even funny. This is all commercialized garbage. E-40 is all on this ""hyphy"" tip now, lmao how wack is that. Hyphy is straight wack, the lyrics have no concept what so ever. All pointless.  Production, well yea all these commercialized albums got production, like this album. But then again where are the lyrics?   This is one of those albums where you sit there and like it ONLY because of the beat/hook lol. People that listen to this type of music dont like real Hip-Hop, as I said theyre blind. People that arent big Hip-Hop fans, I dont criticize you for listening, but all you people that claim to be Hip-Hop fans, f*** outta here, you aint.   This album is for commercial rap listeners only, if you like underground STAY away from this at all costs. Pick up some real HipHop instead.  Peace. "
2,"When I first bought this cd I really liked it, but unlike most other cd's it sounded worse with time. After 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and I found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the Killers. After seeing them live at the Virgin Festival this weekend I know they are totally phony, not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever. Do yourself a favor save your money on this one"
5,"When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert,      I like to listen to something quiet and soothing.  THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous ""Pizza boy"" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as ""background music.""  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.  By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)  I actually get the craving for pizza when I'm listening to the album.  The PIZZA TAPES sure is one tasty album. Great music and great pizza, what a winning combination!"
2,"Pls. Rick Nielsen, ""Tell Me Everything""! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's ""Mommy and Daddy"" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant!"
1,"I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon.  What a major disappointment this disk is.  Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good &quot;children's music&quot; inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk"
5,"I MUST SAY THAT WHEN I FIRST HEARD ""KICK PUSH"" I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT THIS GUY REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A METAPHORIC RHYMER AND HIS DELIVERY IS VERY STRONG SO I KNOW I HAD TO BUY LUPE FIASCO'S DEBUT ALBUM ""FOOD AND LIQUOR"". AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED BUT INDEED THIS ALBUM REALLY LET ME KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A FEW RAPPERS OUT THERE THAT ARE STILL KICKING RHYMES ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH IN EVERYDAY LIFE INSTEAD OF HEARING THESE OTHER MC'S THAT DONT RAP ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT CARS, CLOTHES, JEWELRY, AND WOMEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS A FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE THIS ALBUM WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS IN LIFE.  MY 5 FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: 1.""THE COOL""- THIS SONG IS BASICALLY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD DIED(NOT LITERALLY) BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE AND TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CHOSE TO LIVE HIS LIFE THE SAME WAY HE HAD LIVED IT ONCE BEFORE. SONG IS VERY METAPHOR AND DEEP. 2.""HE SAY SHE SAY""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESNT HAVE A VISIBLE FATHER AND IT IS AFFECTING HIM DEEPLY. 3.""HURT ME SOUL""- THIS SONG TALKS JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF FROM WOMEN BEING DEGRADED IN RAP MUSIC, DRUG DEALING, CROOKED COPS, GOVERNMENT NOT OFFERING BLACK PEOPLE WELFARE AND OVERCHARGING HEALTHCARE, JOHNS AND PROSTITUTES. SONG ALSO HAS A VERY NICE HOOK. 4.""SUNSHINE""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IN A CLUB EVENTHOUGH HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE HE CANNOT RESIST IT WITH THIS GIRL. 5.""PRESSURE"" FEATURING JAY-Z- VERY NICE CONCEPT TO IT FROM LUPE'S STANDPOINT AND EVENTHOUGH IM NOT A BIG JAY-Z FAN HE STILL PUT DOWN A NICE VERSE.  OTHER SONGS I LIKE ARE ""JUST MIGHT BE OK"", ""DAYDREAMININ"", ""KICK PUSH"", ""I GOTCHA"",""INSTRUMENTAL"", AND ""AMERICAN TERRORISTS"".  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL!!!!"
5,"I can't rate this one highly enough. It's certainly in a vein with his last couple, but, as has been oft noted, it's more political and full of social commentary. Some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones, as a result. I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs.  By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book ""Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music."" It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana. And Rodney shows up prominently throughout the book; there's a whole section just about this album"
1,"I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was ""Grind With Me"" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.  I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond ""Baby Blue"", and Slick -- and I use the term ""rapper"" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single ""Grind With Me"" is really called ""Grind On Me"", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but ""Playhouse"" isn't far behind. And ""Nothing But a Number"" is very, very statutory.  Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like ""If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right"" on ""Grind On Me"", or ""If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'"" on ""Grill `Em"" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like ""FROM THE BACK!"" on ""Get a Little Closer"", and ""Yes, sir!"" on ""Your Body"". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on ""Shorty Be Mine"" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.  Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on ""Never Let You Go"", ""Can't Live Without You"", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs ""Chevy"" and ""Grill `Em"". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of ""Your Body"", dammit, I'll beat it up.  Anthony Ruper"
5,"Wow...what a great collection of songs, a wonderful album. I am a fan of the Church, but even if you have never heard of them, you will find this disc amazing. I am at a loss of words to decribe the songs. My only regret is that there is not a DVD of performances of these songs. I would go upstairs and watch it all night"
5,Really well done. This is an extremely well crafted CD. Six Days is probably the best song on here.  Note: The song when they're waiting for bow wow's car is       Ooh Aah - Grit
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. "
2,"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just ""a little slow"" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and ""deep"", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty.     "
2,"I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2."
2,"I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation ""i'm your man"" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of ""if it be your will"" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. ""If It be your will"" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. ""mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ."" or ""i am so very happy, so please hit me"" or ""river of sorrow, don't swallow"" or the breathy way he says the word ""twilight"" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says ""if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people"". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved ""if it be your will"" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort."
2,"Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him"
1,"I don't care what others stated...Sabata rushed the opera to fit the LP capability, Maria screamed at all times, no pianissimis, and everyone was super high charged like they must finish the recording on time to fit the album.  Best Tosca is Maria Callas with Pretre recording.  Don't buy this mono recording.  Maria did not understand who Tosca was during this moment"
2,"Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me.  A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying.  Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad.  I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.    But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible.  They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.  Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times"
1,"perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched"
5,I love this new CD from Amos Lee.    The first single is entitled Shout Out Loud.  This song really puts me in a great mood.  His guitar playing is so energetic here.  My favorite track is Long Line Of Pain though.  It is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness. Sympathize is an another highlight on this disc.  Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck.  Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the  charm of a girl from the south.  Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one.  Freedom is an interesting track.  It is a reminder that the pursuit of  freedom should not lead to violence.  The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special.  Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend.  I love the feeling of loss and sense of  hurt in Amos' voice on this track.   Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer
2,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD"
5,"Once again, Audra McDonald proves that she's the best musical theatre singer since Streisand. While many fans might quibble with her selections (mostly covers of rock and pop songs), her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none"
2,"Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector.  The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable.  Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off.  Even Robin's latest redition ""A Live CD"" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies.  And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family.  Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers.  So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.  A devoted listener talisman, Dundee "
1,"The Black Eyed Peas are the WORST group is rap HISTORY! Its hard to believe that anyone could make music worse than the Black Eyed Peas. This group is an embarasment to Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and any other type of music ever created. How and why people continue to support these lame, extremely non-talented rejects of the rap world is completely unbelievable. I thought thier last CD was trash, but this has incredibly surpassed the low mark set by Elephunk, which should have been called, ""Hey let'sell out and attempt to create the worst music ever known to man"". The only good news is that theyll soon be forgotten about as they have just murdered thier musical careers, and will have to resort to doing jingles for commmercials in order to survive. These three unoriginal, talentless, boring, annoying, sellout, fake wanna-bes should stop making ANY kind of music and get completely out of the music business. Tonight I willl pray very hard that these bafoons of the music industry NEVER make another song EVER!!!! To say that they SUCK would be a compliment, they would have to practice constantly for the next 1,000 years THEN make a deal with the devil just to scrape up enough talent to suck! Theyre just that HORRIBLE!!"
1,"Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as ""Ray."").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie ""Ray.""  And to anyone who says that he can write good songs, let's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics:   Yo you sleep  Naw I just um, I think I want some more  Yea I know we just got through  But its just so good, I just caint help it tho'  Its something about your body  Naw it aint all I think about  Well to be honest, oh   Im startin' to believe,  Something's wrong wit me,  Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute  I'm thinkin' `bout it  I can be at my job, in my car, up in church  And when I try to pray it off, it won't work  It seems that I caint get enough of   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Its getting to the point where I (where I)  I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs  Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)  I aint proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me  And I caint help it, caint shake it  (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Some call it bad, some call it good  Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood  I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh   Some like it slow, some like it fast  It don't matter the tempo long as it lasts  I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh    -Wow, that's a big pile of garbage!  Lyrics like that should easily win him a Grammy.  Keep it up, Jamie! "
2,"There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow ""Singin in the Bathtub"" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time"
5,"Like all of Antony's Music, this EP has a chilling and superhuman quality to it. Unlike his other stuff, the production is toned down on the non-album tracks (""The Lake"" and ""The Horror Is Gone"") to a stark, white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of Antony & The Johnsons. The album track, ""Fistful of Love"", is one of my favourite Antony songs, a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish.  Though the price is a bit steep, this is a great addition to any Antony fan's library"
4,"I am not a CLAY-MATE... howver, Clay Aiken is without-a-doubt the best runner-up from any season of AI.  That being said...I still wasn't sure if I would like this CD.  And I didn't---at first.  But then, after hearing it a few more times, I actually grew to like most of the songs.  Not all of them, which is why I didn't give him 5 stars, but it is a very good album.  My favorite happens to be the title track.  But, there are several more good songs on the CD.  Whether or not you are into this style of music, you can't argue that Clay Aiken has one of the best male voices around.  Probably the best male voice of his age.  I would recommend this CD to any one who is into Adult Contemporary.  Of course, if you are a Clay-mate, then I don't have to tell you anything :"
1,"As a big fan of the Postal Service (their ""Give Up"" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)""Last Songs"" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service"
4,"This is a very different sounding Paul Simon album.  The influence of Brian Eno is obvious and at times over-the-top.  My conclusion, now that I've had this album for a while, is that it's not one that I'm constantly listening to but, when I'm in the mood, this is really an interesting and fun album.  Occasionally, Paul reaches heights I don't feel he's reached since Graceland.  There are some great songs on here.  If you're looking for ""Still Crazy after all these years"" or ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" - type songs, you're not going to find them here.  If you're interested in hearing Paul push the envelope, however, this is the one.  Paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one"
1,"I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the ""look at it a week from now and see how you feel"" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it."
2,"I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art.  People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages.  They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks.  Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears.  To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.    I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.  Creative; maybe.  Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no"
1,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience"
1,"Boy, and I thought ""Cats"" was bad. This is the single most boring, stupid, pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears. There is no story line, no range in music, no feeling, no lyrics to back up the awful music. I mean, the list could go on forever. I warn you, it's the biggest waste of $25.00 that you might, no, will ever spend. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and trust me. DON""T BUY THE CD!!! And if you do, when you put it on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.You've been warned. Now please, spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life"
5,"If you like this album, if you like the title track, it might inspire a few hard core fans to know that the original inspiration for both the name of the band, and especially the title track, is the masterpiece of a western, ""Bad Company""- 1972.  The whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film's soundtrack, by ""Fantasticks"" Harvey Schmidt.  The song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until I saw the film itself.  It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges.  It's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination, but to fans of the band itself, to help make the song more meaningful, as it has for me!!  I highly recommend them both"
5,"I have held back from doing an online review because I recognize that my objectivity isn't well, very objective when it comes to Elton John.  I love everything he does (even ""Victim of Love""!).  But I could no longer resist.  This CD is magnificent.  Elton John and Bernie Taupin have crafted a work that spans generations, bridges gaps and even pays homage to personal and artistic lapses over the years.  It is an honest, courageous and celebratory reflection of the terrain these two geniuses have traversed over some 37 years.  That's the depth of ""The Captain and the Kid.""  But let's not get lost in the depths here, either.  This CD is one great listen.  Even if you're not interested in the history...even if you're just a casual fan (can one just be a casual Elton John fan??)  or just like good music, ""The Captain and the Kid"" is great entertainment.  It has it all...great arrangements, great piano playing from Elton and of course, hooks abound.  No one...that's right, no one can write a hook like Elton.  These songs stay with you...they become your companions on YOUR journey, and like good wine, they get better and better.  I must also write a word of support for all who have written regarding so many artists doing retreads of old standards/hits.  I know, I know, this stuff is selling like there's no tomorrow.  I suppose, as much as I can't bear another Rod Stewart retread CD ( I loved Rod though most of his career...I just can't stand what he's done over the last five years...Rod...please STOP!) I guess the attraction/appeal of these CD's is that the buyer knows they're going to get a full CD's worth of good (or at least known) songs from a reliable artist.  True, it is not as easy as it used to be to find many CD's today that are original and good from start to finish...CD's tend to be longer than LP's and therefore run the risk of running out of steam, and let's face it...many do. Oh, the classic CD's, they're out there, you might have to do some mining before striking gold, however.  Sadly, ""The Captain and the Kid"" did not ignite the charts.  I cannot understand it. And I do realize that popularity has nothing to do with greatness. Yet, this IS truly a great CD, a work of art that deserves to be heard.  It is a throw back to the glory days, yet it is not dated in the least. And one listen...just one puts you right back on the yellow brick road, platform shoes and all! No, I suppose you can't go back...not totally anyway, but it is oh so nice take one more sweet ride with The Captain and the Kid. "
1,Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others
2,"Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut ""Lucky To Know You.""  ""Seeing Through You"" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like ""Lucky To Know You."" "
4,"Be Human does not disappoint! It has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when I say 4stars I mean it. When I say 5stars I usually mean a ten. Were I to do sound for a futuristic play I would feel gratified in using some of this. I think Yoko Kanno knows the Secret of Life and she shares her formula...with us, time-and-time again. I happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces; but if I had to choose american rhythm or Yoko Kanno, I would choose Yoko Kanno. I wonder if she's ever been nominated for a grammy? In my book she's world-class!As-I-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify  four-stars. No worries here"
5,This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio
1,This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.  He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.  I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable
2,"I have always liked R. Kelly's music.  When he produced ""Trapped in the Closet"", I thought it was a joke.  This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard."
2,"Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  ""Get Your Hustle On"" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  ""I Know You Know"" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  ""Around The Way"" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  ""Sets Go Up"" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single ""Rodeo"" is the millennium version of ""Back That [...] Up"" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  ""What's Happenin'"" is nothing to write home about, ""Loose Booty"" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and ""Break A Brick Down"" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. ""Who's Ya Daddy"" is pointless, along with the annoying ""Keep Talkin'"" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and ""Why Not.""  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on ""Rock Like That.""  The biggest shocker has to be ""Addicted"" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of ""The Rain."")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come. "
2,"There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.  Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.  The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).  Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).  P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter. "
1,"BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!!"
1,"I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song ""Good is Good"" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned ""crimes"" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some ""SOUL."" Peace"
1,"And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of ""covers"" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' ""First Utterance,"" the Incredible String Band's ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" or Shirley Collins' ""No Roses"" instead"
5,"This album showcases Collin Raye's amazing tenor to the fullest. Hits like ""Love Me,"" ""Little Rock,"" ""My Kind of Girl,"" ""Not That Different,"" and ""I Can Still Feel You"" are featured on this brilliant album. Raye's vocals are well done, as is the song selection. Most of the songs are ballads, Raye's specialty. If you are a fan of Collin Raye, then this album is a must-have."
1,"I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a ""hip hop teeny bopper"". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should"
5,"Though Dylan and the Band had played together a lot before this record (the Basement tapes and the 1967 tour), this is the first recording of them together that was released and I must say the Band's playing on this record is vastly different than those times, different than the live ""Before the Flood"" as well. I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work. Love songs, dirges, uplifting songs, tough songs and torch songs, this is a record for the ages. Yes, it was overshadowed by ""Blood on the Tracks,"" but it's been years now and still ""Planet Waves"" stands the test of time. I really like this record"
1,"Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style."
1,"Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why ""remake"" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to ""No More Kings"" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!"
1,"Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this"
1,"What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review"
5,"If you are looking for just a general overview of Iggy's career, I'd say this is a pretty good way to go.  It contains a bit of music from each section of his career"
5,"This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the ""Titanic"" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: ""National Treasure Suite"" (Track 1). The Tracks: ""Library of Congress"" (Track 4), and ""Declaration of Independence"" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: ""Spectacle Discovery"" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money"
5,This CD is a must have if you are a Hot Boys (Old school Cash Money) fan
2,"...don't buy this CD.  Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy.  There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan.  It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well.  The upsides to this compilation are as follows:  one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive.  However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all"
1,How can they even call this punk. Were's six feet under or slayer. Maybe some cibo matto. These are the bands they need to add....... Not yellowcard and other crummy emo band
2,"RBX is one of my favorite rappers, he has a dark, sinister style. Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me"
4,"Seth Maheu ""College Student""....your high. remedy is probably the song i like LEAST on this album. i hate it. the rest of the songs are awesome though, my favs are ""because of me"" ""world falls away"" ""tongue"" and ""simplest mistake"". this cd is a solid effort.  and seth, you know Ef all about music. the fact u like remedy the best, and suggested that anything by lloyd banks is worth buying shows you have terrible taste. Jurrassic 5 are good, but ""amazing lyricism""?? no. jurrasic 5 are good because they are fun, and keep the forumla simple and old school. true hip hop. but there are LEGIONS of more talented emcees.   dont EVER say anything about lloyd banks again. he is terrible and makes outdated, gangster BS. he should get over himself and stop furthering the stereotypes everyone has of hip-hop. hip-hop has a terrible name becuase of losers like him, 50, ja, and eminem (yeah he USED to be good).  BUY THIS SEETHER ALBUM"
1,I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful.  The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah.  I don't recomend this at all.  If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better
2,"There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.  Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.  Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!  Why are the vocals so ""hot""?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.  Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.  Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.  Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.  It's vintage, but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast"
2,"That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better"
5,"Absolutely great collection of Alan Jackson's best, without the filler.  A must-have.  By the way, is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that Alan Jackson's ""songwriting skills need work""?!"
4,"In 1987 Barry, Robin, and Maurice were reunited! Or at least that's how new distributor Warner Brothers tried to sell it.  Even though the brothers never really left themselves or us, but  I digress.  I only have this album on cdr, since Warner's seemed to make the release very scarce.  The cover is cool, though.  The boys look totally different from when audiences remembered them last. No white, no hair, well not as much anyway.  Black. Dark, edgy.  I'm Pip and I've come to play!          ESP is naturally the song to lead off the album.  It is different from any other project the Brothers did at the time.  Better than Walls Have Eyes, more polished than Now Voyager.  However, ESP is also very stand alone on this album and nothing else here sounds like it.  (Not that I mind that of course.)  We heard some of Robin's coming out voice party on Living Eyes, but in songs shared with Baz.  Barry moved onto some heavy producing, but without Robin.  ESP brings them together again and slams both powerhouses.  There is so much going on in this song, you can imagine this is what a telepath hears. Noise, each trying to have its own say, competing with everything else that is heard, and all of it's important.  Brilliant.          Ah, You Win Again.  Although not as well know in the US as the Fever Monsters, this song is indeed one of those monster songs that you just have to love.  There are so many hooks, lines, and sinkers musically, lyrically, vocally. From the whole second verse's play on `Nobody stops this body' to Robin's Oh Baby! wail to that bombing drum throughout.  Hot damn.  This song did actually even encroach the US charts, imagine that!         Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)  (What is it with them and parenthesis?) is the first slow song presented.  Barry returns to his shrill notes and sometimes the versus are tough to understand.  The chorus is strong and the lyrics as always are top notch.  The ad-libbed over the top ending is perfect eighties power ballad fashion.  The music and high voices are a little dated, but you can't help but try and sing along when your driving home alone late at night, or is that just me?          Giving Up The Ghost  sound a bit more like the tracks on Walls Have Eyes, but that's ok. Great music rifts.  Some of the refrains are a bit much, and one of the times where I might say the chorus is the weaker part of the song. Then again, the boys hold out `Ghooooost!' and it sounds cool again.  Robin sounds great in the verses, since you can understand him seventy percent of the time.  ;0)        The Longest Night is one of the hotter Bee Gees songs in my opinion, just like Bodyguard.  After their solo and side projects in the early eighties, the brothers came back for ESP stronger again.  Robin with this song has somehow managed to combine the weeping Joke sound with the booming voice he developed post Fever.  The vibrato was always there, but the five o'clock shadow eighties sounds fit Robin's haunting lyrics as the sixties mellow sound did.   Indeed ESP together with Walls Have Eyes is a dang good hunk of Gibb material that it seems everyone missed. Pity.          Every album has to have a fun song and This Is Your Life is ESP's.   It's nice to see the Brothers come back and kind of laugh off and yet embrace their past music.  The lyrics `line-drop' titles of other Bee Gees songs during the interlude.  Can I tell you this is the only time I sing to `JJJive Talkin'!  It's Barry rapping but with dribs and drabs from the old songs cutting in and out. Very cool.  I could recommend the entire album on that interlude alone if I had to, but I don't.         Outside of its sweet and soft lyrics and vocals, Angela  is in my mind a little bit of a statement song.   Sometimes it feels like you can almost exchange `Angela' for `America'.  Followed by the line `I'm still alive', I wonder if the boys were making a veiled statement at us stubborn Yanks.  Indeed they were still alive, and maybe this is also a pun on Stayin' Alive. The New York times effect a man, remember.  ;0)  The feel of the song is so innocent and easy feeling, but I suspect more!  The girl that got away? I think not.          Maurice brings this album to a standstill with Overnight.  It's the closest in vein to the song ESP.  Maurice, however, adds not telepathy, but animal magnetism.  It's a different kind of psychic sense.  The lyrics  are so detailed and the interlude combining the echo of all three voices is exceptional.  The music has, if there is such a thing, a predatory feeling that's good.  By the end of the song you are totally sold and yelling back, ""All right I'll stay!""         In the eighties and later on High Civilization, The Brothers seem to have a little Motown tribute revival thing going. Crazy For Your Love is fascinating in that it is has a Motown throwback vibe and at the same time, it's straight eighties bubblegum pop.  (Tiffany, anyone?)  I would cringe if I heard some tween today singing any song about love and ice cream .  However, play Crazy for a kid today, they will like it, and never know it is old men singing in 1987!  How ingenious is it to find such a timeless song here?!         Backtafunk  is not your traditional Gibb song.  It sounds a bit...I want to say New Edition! Naturally the brothers master all the hip beats and singing, even if the lyrics are slightly bland.  Again however, the breakaway interlude makes the song.  The harmony and fun of the boys come in and the song kicks up to another level.  Is Barry scatting? Incredible!         ESP ends with the ESP Vocal Reprise, and I don't really know why.  Its  just the opening echo of the voices on the first track, but it does sound cool. Allow me to mention the oddities associated with ESP, as you knew there would be some! Young Love is an unreleased cut that didn't make the album.  I managed to download a piece that cuts short, but it's heavy in the low key Maurice vein.  Honestly I don't know why it was cut.  The 1989 compilation Tales From The Brothers Gibb contains an ESP Demo that is very similar to the final version, just missing a few production marks.  Fans should also check out The One For All Tour VHS and DVD for concert footage of the boys singing Giving Up The Ghost and extras from One.          Warner Brothers does not realize The Bee Gees quality they possess, and they should re-release ESP.  I wonder if this album planned to have any sort of theme to it? Each song touches a different type of emotion and vibe, and aren't songs in a way a psychic connection from one person to another? Interesting theory, Kristin. Interesting. "

1,"I was just speechless when i first heard this. What was known as the best heavy metal band on earth 10 years prior, has become a lion without balls or teeth. Country-influenced tunes!? Slow, blues-influenced songs? NO way, NO thanks.  Also a very overrated album. The Black Album was OKAY but 3 stars in my book..but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for Metallica.PS: The Memory Remains and Unforgiven 2 are HORRIBLE SONGS."
5,"These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever"

I saw the Las Vegas production, not the the original London production yet the music sung and played in the LV production was just as fantastic as that within the original production. If you like ABBA,(and who does not?) and cannot spring for the price of a ticket, this DVD is the next best thing"

5,"""The Who Sell Out"" is one among ( at least 3 ) several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.  1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album ""Armenia in the Sky"". The outstanding single ""I Can See For Miles"" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.   The acoustic ""Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand"" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.  Songs like ""Odorono"" and ""Tattoo"" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.   ""Our Love Was"" and ""I Can't Reach"" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album ""A Quick One"".   I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.   Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic ""Sunrise"" is quite beautiful, but ""Rael"" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.  Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.   Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals."
5,"This album demonstrates the musical mastery of the legendary Who. It's also interesting how today's groups like Green Day and Limp Bizkit don't even close to the Who.

I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love is a very, very good release. All the songs are awesome, and the intensity and ferocity that drew me MCR in the first place is well in place on this album. But, it seems that they were still finding their sound and direction on this album. Very good album, but the recording is very raw, semi-okay production. But nevertheless a great release that you must check out...My favorite song is Drowning lessons"

4,"Few people are aware that Dave Thomas, in addition to being the founder and spokesman of the Wendy's hamburger chain, was also the leader of Pere Ubu. Clearly Mr. Thomas wasn't in it for the money, since he made his fortune selling good old-fashioned hamburgers, and so he was free to pursue his own musical muse. The results are sometimes splendid, sometimes things go awry, but it's always the unique stylings of Dave Thomas that characterize this raw, passionate music. Kinda makes you wonder what would have happened if Carl Karcher, founder of Carl's Junior, had also pursued music with such abandon and freedom from financial considerations"
1,"It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was ""Today"", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was ""Disarm"" which I hated from day one, and the same with ""Cherub Rock"". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is ""Mayonaise"" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's"
1,"This CD is a total misrepresentation.  MANY of the songs are VERY poorly done concert versions of songs.  They even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs.  Buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection.  Don't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits.  14 songs are live.  One appears to be re-recorded.  The rest are the originals.  Also, on CD #2 many of the media tags are incorrect.  When you play ""All I Really Need Is You"" (Live) the title ""Heartbreak Hotel"" shows.  When you play ""Headed for the Future"" the song title ""All I Really Need Is You"" shows.  When you play ""Heartbreak Hotel"" the song title ""Headed for the Future"" shows.  Overall, a VERY sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality"

It's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever (not completely horrible,though)and the fact that this band is led by a singer who shouldn't be bragging about his ""musical genius"" when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers,isn't sweetening the deal.When i bought this album,it had a sticker on it that read:""If you like Taking Back Sunday,Brand New and The Used,you'll love Matchbook Romance!""I should have known how desperate they were when i read that.But more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to Taking Back Sunday? TBS is actually an emo band that doesn't sound recicled.And Brand New?Have they heard Deja Entendu?That album is not only the best emo album,but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre"
5,"I'm afraid Alfonso Lozada has missed the point. The film is about a span of time in the life of one person, Tony Wilson, and is thus structured around his experiences. At the same time, the film is not a documentary but a fictionalized account. On top of all this, the &quot;Tony&quot; character does mention the short shrift the Stone Roses get. Is it really a surprise to find the soundtrack album bereft of artists which did not appear in the film"
4,"For me, there have always been those bands where I like them but can only listen to a few of the songs because of the lead singers voice. This would include Maroon 5, Billy Talent, and Clap Your Hands Say Yea. While I applaud these bands for being unique, it is hard to listen to an entire cd of it. Hot Hot Heat is one of the only exceptions I have ever had. I can listen to their cd's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track. While anything can become irritating, it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me. I am also not a huge fan of these new English bands like Snow Patrol and Arctic Monkeys, but yet again Hot Hot Heat has something that just sticks with me. I recommend this cd as well as Make Up The Breakdown. Very good, upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home"
5,This is the best R&B female album out this year. I listen to this CD all day. Although it has 10 songs like the other chick... Monica has something to say and relates to many women out there. I love this CD. My favorite is Hell No. If you have not done so go and get this immediatley especially if you wasted your money on BDay like I did
5,"Well Crossfade may just be another modern rock Alt Metal band but that doesn't make them bad. Sure, they don't really add anything new to the music out now but that shouldn't take away from the music itself. All I know is from what I heard they have some really good tracks. I first heard the track ""Cold"" on the radio and it was just one of those songs that I love instantly. I just had to go out and get the album. After getting the album It turned out to be pretty good. I pretty much enjoyed everything on here. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be ""Cold"", ""Starless"", ""Colors"", and ""Dead Skin"". Here's the track ratings...  1. Starless - 9.5/10  2. Cold - 10/10  3. So Far Away - 9.5/10  4. Colors - 10/10  5. Death Trend Setta - 10/10   6. The Deep End - 9/10 7. No Giving Up - 9.5/10 8. Dead Skin - 10/10 9. Disco - 7/10  10. The Unknown - 9/10  Overall: 93% A-  Sure, it's not really anything new but It is good and a nice listen. I enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what Crossfade has done with their new album that was just released. Anyway, anyone who's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection. "
4,"Out of Exile, like the debut, rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore. Again we see Rick Rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock. Chris Cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics. Indeed the fact that Cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over. Lucky for us that they did.  This second instalment of the Audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing. The riffs are so smooth - who let the 70's back in? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff. This album does fell a little mellower overall. Not sure if that's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut.  This ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up. Sure it's sales weren't up there with the debut but it's as consistent as the first album and it's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there. In the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along.  Token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover"
5,"The movie is awesome, but the cd is equally amazing.  Awe-inspiring, from quiet, peaceful music to the full orchestra in the finale at the end, this is one of the best soundtracks ever written!  A great gift to yourself or friends"
2,"I absolutely loved that song ""Carry On Wayward Son"" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars"
4,"This is a somewhat interesting exploration of language, semantics and rhythm.  It is more surreal in it's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts.  Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, ""An Animated Description of Mr. Maps"" for a very clear example of such.  While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation.  Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring"
1,"Knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of Dire Straits. Perhaps he is attempting to be Mr. Atkins reincarnate, but if that is the case then he should  buy the white shoes and move to Florida. Simply put, a terrible album with little to recommend it."
1,"I feel sorry for those who thought this was more great YES-Jon Anderson Christmas music.  I'm one of the few fortunate souls who actually found a 3 Ships CD after it was out of print.  Paid some $30+ for it, but worth every penny.  Too bad ripping and passing out mp3's is illegal, because I'd share!  Add my name to the ""Bring Back 3 Ships!"" petition"
5,"On What's Left of Me, Nick Lachey sings about lost love and heartbreak for they whole duration of the CD.  This is his version of No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom CD.  Every song is about a broken relationship.  The Lyrics are very good and the songs are also very well done.  Don't buy this CD if you are looking for his SoulO upbeat fluff.  The tone of this CD is sad.  Most of the songs are ballads.  But not slow ballads more like pop rock power ballads.  He has a great voice.  It is strong and has a great tone.  Out of every boy-bander I have ever heard I would say he has the most talent.  Not only is his voice strong but it is also great because he sounds like a man not a girl, (i.e. Justin Timberlake).  The stand out tracks are: I Can't Hate You Anymore, On Your Own, and Beautiful.  The rest of the songs are good too.  This CD finally makes him a legitimate music star"
2,"I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd"
1,"The show rocks, the soundtrack sucks. I didn't recognize any of the songs from the show, that alone tells you how memorable this soundtrack is. Dismal and dissapointing :"
1,"I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the ""my life sucks"" and ""everyone hates me"" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD"
2,"Kate Bush's second album, ""Lionheart"", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing ""The Kick Inside Part Two"", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.  Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (""In Search of Peter Pan"", ""In the Warm Room""), a more pop structure (""Wow""), rhythmic shifts (""Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake"") an almost shuffle (""Fullhouse"") and a gret rock song (""Hammer Horror"").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (""Symphony in Blue"") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (""Kashka from Baghdad"").  The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing ""Kashka from Baghdad"" can be all that bad, and certainly ""Symphony in Blue"" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut (""The Kick Inside"") or the stunning ""Never For Ever"""
2,"this CD is not good.  Luckily, I only paid 5 bucks for the used copy.  I mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs?  I don't.  The couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets 2 stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves.  Bruce really took a page from Gene's book here and went after the money.  Should be an EP and nothing more"
2,"This cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced. Any 1999 cd should have better sound quality. Like the other reviewers stated,i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately 1 minute long each.Gotta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer. They could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators. Curiously too,where is the NWO's music"
1,"Painful to hear and painful to watch.  A yester-year pop singer who doesn't have the courage to quit.  There is nothing left to do so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album to stay in the spotlight; if that isn't the highest form of egoism I don't know what is.  She's got fame she's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please?  What she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic.  The woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance.  She uses anything from sex to religion to self promote.  Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.  I challenge Madonna to put on a concert without all the antics and overt sexual malarkey that dominates her shows; she would be booed right off the stage if that were to happen.  And please enough with the crucifixion stunts all ready.  "
4,This album is what the goo is all about.......they were at their BEST here!!!!!!!!!!  This was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again
1,"Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it."
5,"Bob is the King!  The KING!  Get this disc, you will dig it.  You can really sense the urgency in this CD.  Go to Bob's site, check out some of his notes on the Album.  If you can make to Austin, TX, spend about 2 weeks going to Bob's shows and you will understand.  From Joe Rockhead to Texas Bluegrass Masacre, Bob's the real deal, always pushing boundries, coming up with new sounds, un-corporate, straight ahead Rock and Roll"
5,"I'm trying to get everything he ever did, a real her"
5,Don''t waste anymore time in reading reviews.  Go and get this album
1,"I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down."
1,"bought this cd quite a while ago. it is probably very good, but how can i tell when it won't play on my stereo? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans. this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets. after buying the disc, i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says ""audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc."" WHAT A GREAT IDEA: SELL A DISC TO PEOPLE THAT WON'T PLAY FOR EVERYBODY. THANKS A..HOLES"
5,"I AM A TRUE SMOOTH JAZZ FAN AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST CD BRIAN HAS EVER MADE."" COME ON UP "" IS GOOD BUT ""NICE AND SLOW"" IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.LISTEN ONE TIME AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED I KNOW I WAS.                                   "
5,Nicholas Reyes has the absolutely perfect voice for this music...a fantastic collection of energetic rhythms to  keep you moving!!  
1,For a group that exudes such passion in their music (LIVE FROM BUFFALO anybody?) this song is like a funeral dirge. I can only hope that they haven't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are.  Take your time guys - let's get your BEST work.   T
5,"I rated this album 5 stars because it wouldn't let me do a 4.9 star. 3:16 was the perfect LP. This is very close. There is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with, Walk Like A Man, but still, the cd is one of the best yet.  Let me say this, I have 3 Murs CDs, The end of the beginning, 3:16, and now Murray's Revenge. This is the second best of the 3. Track 6, Dreamchaser, is definately worth putting on repeat all day. That is my favorite song on the cd.  All of the tracks on here are solid.   For someone trying to get a feel for Murs and his style, he uses a lot of samples in his beats like Kanye West, and his flow, well, hes in a league of his own. One of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time. He is not underground, but not big yet either. He deserves air time. His tracks aren't aimed for that like say, a Nelly or Little Jon.  All I can say is, Murs deserves to be one of the TOP emcees in the business. And in my opinion, he is, by far. It would be interesting to see a colaboration between Murs and say, Mos Def or The Roots.  All in all, BUY THIS CD"
5,"Bow Wow Wow is not a Household Name, They Charted Once in the USA with ""I want Candy"" (Top 50), and released only 3 Proper Albums...Their Sound is Tribal, the Lead Singer Annabella often Yelps to Percussive Drumming and throbbing Bass, The Mixture yields Many Great Tunes, but it can take getting used to, as it did for Me, I was not a Fan untill much listening...If You don't know a lot of the Group's Songs, I suggest listening to as many 30 second Samples as possible to get a feeling of whether this stuff is digestible...Most of the Songs here are first-rate, I particularly Love ""TV Savage"", ""Golly Golly Go Buddy!"" and ""Louis Qatorze"", along with Annabella's Solo Turn ""Fever""....If You want to explore further, I suggest the CD ""Girl Bites Dog: Your Compact Disc Pet"" to round out Your Collection, it includes more Gems, such as ""Sexy Effiel Tower"" (Where 14 Year-Old Annabella Pants Orgasmically...and more authentically than Donna Summer)and ""Radio G String"", as well as 3 Cuts from this CD in different versions; But begin here, and don't go further unless You Adore this CD...."
5,"One of my top fave Rasputina albums. Tons of great songs, very few joke songs, and great art work"
5,"I've been listening to Chris Cornell for about two years, after discovering him in Audioslave. Then I heard ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman"" and after that more or less forgot about Soundgarden. My friend lent me this CD one day and I forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well...Wow. First off, Chris Cornell has one of the strongest, most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it's amazing. These songs are all hard, raw, catchy, and all have a great guitar & drum sound. ""Outshined"" is probably my favorite Soundgarden song of all time. No rock fan should pass this up:  1. Rusty Cage-5/5-One of my favorite Soundgarden songs. It's fu**ing great; Chris Cornell hits some great notes too. 2. Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer! The chorus is catchy as hell. 3. Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-Chris Cornell has an awesome screaming voice. This song has some good lyrics, guitar solo is good, and Matt Cameron's drumming stands out. 4. Jesus Christ Pose-5/5-I don't know what this song is about, but it kicks  a$$. The music (guitar & drumming anyway) is really good. 5. Face Pollution-5/5-Great title, the song is OK. The shortest song on the album. I know I'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of Tool) is singing gibberish at the end. 6. Somewhere-5/5-The most harmonious song on the album, but there's still some ""screamage"". 7. Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-The opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating ""The devil sounds like this"" and then Cornell begins singing is great. Really good lyrics too. 8. Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-The music is good, but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music;  hence 4/5 9. Mind Riot-5/5-Easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs. Cornell sings the song perfectly. 10. Drawing Flies-5/5-Lyrics are good. 11. Holy Water-5/5-(No Comment) 12. New Damage-5/5-One of the best on the album. The album goes out with a bang!  "
5,"I have to say my fav songs are when Amy Lee sits down at the piano and isn't up running around, she sounds *wonderful*. "
4,"I first listened to this CD on my work sound system which does not do it justice.  I was only mildly impressed and was preparing to submit a scathing review with the main focus being ""mediocrity at its best.""  But then I took it home and put it on a real sound system. VOILA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  While I still contend that Gerald is infinitely more viable as a premiere session man than a solo artist, this second outing with GRP is far superior to ""Groovology;""  the former project seemed to be a classic example of an artist suffering from musician's block. ""Kickin' It"" is the exact opposite - with help from the likes of Jeff Lorber and George Duke, it appears creativity was at an all-time high with the end result being a wonderful project that you will enjoy over and over again.  The arrangements are tight with fresh interpretations, a nice ode to Jr. Walker and some oh so nice tunes in collaboration with Lorber.  Quite honestly, I haven't been this impressed with a Gerald Albright project in quite a whie.  It appears he is finally hittinhg his stride and I could not be more pleased.  Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice, Gerald!!!"
4,"Originally released in 1993, Dark Tranquility's Skydancer remains a masterpiece.  Along with At the Gates, In Flames, Carcass, Death and Edge of Sanity, Dark Tranquility created the genre known as melodic death metal. Everything expected of a good melodic death album is here. Aggresive sounds juxtaposed with acoustic parts, an inteligent concept and growled vocals.  Mikeal Stanne is one of the only vocalists who can sound pissed off and peaceful all at the same time.  Many of the ideas such as using female vocals for different effects were way ahead of their time as well. Can't give a perfect rating though because while it's original, the production isn't very well done and they hadn't quite hit the peak of their skills yet"
2,"I was not pleased with the quality of this recording.  The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster.  The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy!  The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible.  I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from ""The Bells of Dublin"" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded).  The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one"
5,"Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other.  It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility.  When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, ""out of my body, out of my skin,"" you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production.  The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of ""One More Hour,"" the fury of ""Words and Guitar,"" the sexiness of ""Dance Song '97.""  This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart"
5,"hes great to listen to, his songs are really good and are easy to sing along to especially manifesto # 1 is my fave"
4,"While Steely Dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion, the latest ""Definitive Collection"" brings some of the band's best known work onto a single disc. Also, for completeness, one track each from their 'reunion' CDs are included here. Steely classics such as ""Do It Again"", ""Reelin' In The Years"", ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"", ""Black Friday"", ""Deacon Blues"", ""Peg"" and ""Hey Nineteen"" are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day. While this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning Dan fan because of its songs and low price, it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this Definitive Collection - the all-time classic ""Josie"". Granted, this CD is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish. However, including ""Josie"" and dropping a track like, say ""Dirty Work"" (writer's opinion) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall. I guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection.  Apart from this, Steely Dan's ""Definitive Collection"" is a great introduction to the band. For a more comprehensive overview, check out the double-disc compilation ""Show Biz Kids"" which includes all of the tracks included here (minus the two 'reunion' tracks) plus many many more."
5,"If you've ever liked the T-Bone Walker style, or drooled over the pure T-Bone licks that both Ronnie and Duke have graced us with over the years, ""Two Bones and a Pick"" is eight minutes of pure jump-blues-guitar-heaven.  I can, and do listen to this for hours on end.  If any two white guys have got that jump-blues-guitar-thang down, it's these two.  T-Bone is grinning like a Cheshire cat"
4,First off; I really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least 60 minutes of play time and don't cut out lengthy guitar solos.  This CD certainly delivers in this regard as Ronnie Earl and the Duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid 70 plus minutes.  This is a close 5 star recommendation but it isn't a classic and it isn't groundbreaking; although I would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point.  It's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another.  Highly recommended.
4,"The first time I heard Cannibal Ox was last winter in my friends snowboard video. He did the intro over the first and in my opinion BEST track on the CD Iron Galaxy. Basically that got me interested in the group and I later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever Company Flow.  I copped their CD, but waited a really long time to listen to it. It's pretty futuristic, kind of abstract like Deltron 3030 (another one of my favs), while the lyrical content is nowhere near Deltron (hell, what is?) it is very good. I mean obviously you should expect to hear a LOT of Co-Flow when you listen to this, so if you're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up. The CD has some very good songs A B-Boys Alpha, Atom, and another one of my favorites, The Battle For Asgard. However I think some songs on here tanked the whole album. For one- a couple of the tracks on the CD are weakly produced, Stress Rap & Painkillers. And a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that, Vein & Real Earth.  Basically this CD is 80% genius, so 4 stars is what it gets-and to be honest I'd like to just give it 3.5 because I feel they coulda done a lot better"
1,"Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole ""I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it"" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music"
1,"THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK.

GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION.

I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD"
2,"Kim Waters is one of the nicest persons one could meet, but that still does not prevent me from giving a brutally frank review that will hopefully help him in the future. While I could tell that considerable time was put in this project, that drum machine killed this effort. The music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine, I just can't stand to listen to it. The drum machine cheapens the sound so much that I cannot recommend this CD to real music lovers especially those with decent audio systems. The only composition that sounds like real music is ""Daydreaming"", but this too is somewhat marred by that mechanical drum machine although less than the others. Kim, please use real drums from now on. You are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent, but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine. That machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity. You are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it. It may cost a little more for a real drummer, but you are in a class where real drums are indispensible"
5,"This is an excellent CD.  It is fun to dance to, sing to, and drive to.  It doesn't matter if you like country music or not-you can enjoy Keith Urban's music.  Even better than his CD's are his live shows.  Well worth the ticket price and one of the best concerts you will see. "
5,"Well, I have to confess that I had never heard of Chris until I was taken to a concert back in 2004. Of all the bands that played that night, I have to admit Chris really reached me.  This CD has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock. Chris' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to U2's 'the Edge' especially on 'Forever' which really adds a great dimension to the song.  I had never fully appreciated worship songs until I heard Chris do 'How Great is Our God' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this CD.  Besides those tunes, the CD becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'Indescribable' and other popular songs such as 'Famous One' & 'Raise Up Holy Hands.'  I had been hoping since that concert that he would release a CD from that tour, and my hope has now been answered (imagine that).   2/06 update: eight of us just saw Chris again in Saginaw, MI and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives.  It's certainly difficult for a CD to fully match the experience of being there, but with the right perspective, it can get you pretty close.  Be sure to try and see Chris on his current tour w/Matt Redman & speaker Louie Giglio"
5,"I have to admit, it took me awhile to actually enjoy Relient K. I used to think their music was very generic and their lyrics were cheesy. But this album changed everything for me. Matt Thiessen is such a clever lyricist, using enough word plays to delight the wordsmith in me, but also making me think more deeply about my relationship with God and others.  The band sticks to their standard pop-punk riffs on this album, though I believe they use smoother speed and instrumental transitions on this album. Example: Be My Escape starts with screaming guitars and a fast beat, softens down to keyboards, vocals and light drumming during the verses, back up to rocking during the bridge and chorus, and slows right down for a touching finish. There are several other songs that vary in a like manner.  Lyrically, I really enjoyed Be My Escape (but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair), Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet (I move you, but you just wouldn't budge, I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge), When I Go Down (When I go down, I'll lift my eyes to You, but I won't look too far, 'Cause You'll be there with open arms, to lift me up again...). What a beautiful way to end the album!  Musically, many songs stand out - High of 75 is probably the most original song, starting with acoustic guitar, and including a drum loop in the chorus. Other highlights include Who I am Hates Who I've Been, and Life After Death & Taxes, which combines great vocals with some cool screaming!  Relient K has made a fan out of me, and if you buy this album, it will do the same for you"
1,"I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad. And god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys. Overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep. Stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do.."
2,"If you've listened to Alison Krauss, you've heard the best.  Rhonda's arrangements and voice were adequate, but nothing special, and I doubt I'll listen to the CD again. "
1,"This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive"
2,"In the past few months, I have gotten super into all of Devendra's other works, and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when I first picked this album up.  Oh, what a dissapointment I was in for.  The album does not carry through it's energy as many of Banhart's other albums do so well.  Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do.  That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful.  I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.    So, the moral?  If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet.  I highly recommend ""Cripple Crow"", his split album with Jana Hunter, and, if you are into music that is slightly more raw, ""The Black Babies"", which is my personal favorite"
5,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway"
1,"Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money"
5,"This album further compliments the astonishing work the artist has done along with the spectacular singing of The Love Fellowship Choir! I must say when I hear the work of this ensemble I am all ears because I'm never disappointed in knowing they will always ""Bring it"" !!  God Bless!!"
5,"TERMINAL HEAVEN'S ROCK IS A GREAT SONG! Sick Vibration and OVER AMP are pretty good too. OVER AMP has usual weird english lyrics. ""She lives by fake slide away"".  I highly recomend you get this. It's 12 minutes, 8 seconds a pure good songs. You will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your CD player"
5,"I like every song.  Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD"
2,"all of the songs on this album are very good, however it doesn't live up to standards. sublimes a much better band than this album shows. if your a casual fan, i would not recomoned this to start. instead, i'd recomend ""40 oz. to Freedom"" thats my personal favorite Sublime album. it may not have all the hits on it, but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled. great songs, terrible compilatio"
2,"When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World"
5,"This album was released three years after the New Pornographers awesome debut album. This album is similar, but has a more glossy feel than the previous album. The album is definately more polished. Great synths and percussion throughout the album. Electric Version is an enjoyable and easy listen, chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock's classic humility"
5,"Guns N'Roses are one of my all time favorite bands, so this album is a little disappointing, don't get me wrong, nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving. It just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right, just look at Led Zeppelin's Greatist hits. The only reason the record label released this anyways was because Axl was taking way to long for Chinese Domocracy and they wanted some money, so they put this out, and it has gathered a good deal of money. This Album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know, that Guns N' Roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time. They came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior, and they did just that, they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music. Songs like november rain, welcome to the jungle, and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points, thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan. I would reccomend buying all their albums though, because all of them are genius, except for the spaghetti incident, which was just a cover album anyways.  This album did fail to include classic cuts like Mr.Brownstone, It Ain't easy, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and others and for that I am angry. Also, how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here, it is simply terrible, possibly the worst Guns N' Roses song ever. So, if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums, don't get this, save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come, there have been rumors of a release before the year's end. I have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible, cuts like madagascar, the blues, Rhiad and the Bedouins reaffirmed my belief in Axl, and I think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge. Also check out a band called Rose hill Drive, they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll should enjoy them."
5,A great white noise kind of CD.  Just plain rain.  Well I must admit it sounds a wee bit like frying bacon to me.  Whatever.  My babies both nap really well to it.  I recommend it to my mommy friends.  It's been a must at our house
2,"This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all."
4,"This CD is just okay. The early JB ballads are the thing here. Gives you a good idea of a good chitlin' circuit performance as typically done for Black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response. The standouts here include the extended version of &quot;Lost Someone&quot; which leads into &quot;Please Please Please.&quot; Even without being able to see the infamous cape routine, it's quite entertaining. But overall, Vol. 2 is better since that CD plays up the more uptempo stuff that put JB on the map"
5,"Ok, so KS has a similar voice to Conor Oberst. So what? What's the big deal? Blink-182, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan all sound exactly the same, and they're getting five star reviews! Just lay off of it. And, even though their voices are similar, their music is much different, they sound different. They even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and... well, that's it. But this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band. And, maybe his voice naturally sounds like Conor Oberst's. You can't help that. An Angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds. I pop this CD in from time to time, not my favorite, but it's very good! So, just give this a chance without thinking it as a Bright Eyes rip-off, because that's just what it's not"
5,"I came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate, not knowing what to expect. Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix.  Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt.  And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who.  Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz.  My recommendations are: The Update, Futterman's Rule, Flute Loop, Sure Shot, Heart Attack Man, B-Boys making with the Freak Freak.  Enjoy"
5,"I'm ashamed to say that, even as an adult, I love the music on this CD! The kids listen to it in the car and on their little CD player. They are older (8 and 11), so they already knew the lower times tables, but all the songs are great so we listen to them anyway and now they can remember all the numbers. (They go up to 13.)  It's a long CD - definately longer than other kids music - but it has a story to it that follows along with the songs. It's like listening to a book on tape. After years of Barney and SpongeBob (neither did much for my kids' brains), I'm so glad to have something that *I* can sing along with too"
5,"I had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was, so I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon! Granted, it's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover, but this one fits in my car stereo, makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago! Thanks"
1,"Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB!"
5,"OutKast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity.  This album is crunk, it's exciting, it's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best.  OutKast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way (OutKast is the anti-Black Eyed Peas, LOL).  Stankonia just continues OutKast's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels.  If you've listened to Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik, ATLiens and Aquemini, you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album.  Stankonia is one of the hip hop albums I always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time.  That Andre 3000 is deceptively very, very political, but you gotta pay attention or you'll miss his messages.  Highly recommended LP. Fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary. One of my all-time favorite albums"
1,"This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to ""This Love"" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists"
1,"Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap"
1,"Before you dismiss me as a stupid hater, hear me out. I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.   This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.  However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. ""I Wish"" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled ""O"", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. ""Touch"" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget ""Growing Pains"", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!  However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!   NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career"
