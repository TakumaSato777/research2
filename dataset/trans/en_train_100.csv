1,"Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings ""Lips of an Angel"" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus! "
5,"This music so so wonderful.  It is very high energy and fun.  The kids don't really care that this a ""jazz"" album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy.  Don't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as ""kids"" music, get them something you can both enjoy.  Our favorites are the ""Doodle"" song and ""Potato Chips.""  Worth every penny and then some"
5,This is one of the best kid CDs I've heard.  The songs are all catchy and fun to listen to.  It's a great intro to jazz
5,"This was They Might Be Giants first major label album.  It continued, and expanded upon, the sound they had established on their independant label albums.  It's probably TMBG's most popular album.  It features many classic TMBG songs, like ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", ""Istanbul"" and ""Particle Man"".  It's chock full of the catchy melodies and silly lyrics that we have come to expect from the Johns.  A must have for all They Might Be Giants fans"
5,Our 22 mo. old loves this music much more than the kiddy tunes that mom and dad can hardly bear to listen to.
5,"Hot Hot Heat's Make up the Breakdown is a follow-up of Knock Knock Knock. Personally, if you're a big Hot Hot Heat fan, this will be one of your most favorite albums. Each and every song is unique and has catchy beats that will make you want to dance. The first song Naked in the City Again is great.  The second song, No, Not Now, is a popular tune that you can't help but start movin'. Get in or Get out has some of the most rad keyboarding parts. Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing. Oh Goddamnit is such an amazing song, with very fun lyrics so you're bound to sing along. The next song Aveda keeps many of us wondering: Ex-Girlfriend or Hair Product? Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt. Although very different from Hot Hot Heat's normal songs, In Cairo, is also a great song and adds a fabulous ending to Make up the Breakdown. This cd will be in your stereo for hours on end. The songs are addicting so this album is definately worth it's money. "
5,"Wonderful harmony, great voices, beautiful music.  This group deserves to be better known and to be hugely successful"
1,"The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.  I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's ""trained"" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.  Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.  My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help"
5,"St. Elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [and at times wistful] voice of Cee-Low and thought-provoking lyrics. I enjoy the variety of styles [from the frentic ""Go-Go Gospel"" to the introspective ""Just a Thought""]. A must-have purchase"
2,"the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of ""classic"". I assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i cannot see it as a gothic ""club"" material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i cannot find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would  i was very dissapointed in the whole cd. listened to a few songs here and there, if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past."
4,"Having left my Gothic Club mix CD at home, I decided to buy this one. What hooked me first was the live recording of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" by Bauhaus, which is classic Goth music. Some of the bands I liked, some I didn't, but all in all this is a great CD. My favorite is ""Sheryl"" on the second CD. This is a great CD for chilling, dancing, or showing the uneducated masses what Goth music really is"
2,"Tony Yayo's ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon"" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as ""Tattle Teller,"" ""Curious,"" and ""Project Princess."" For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as ""Live By The Gun"" and ""Homicide,"" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for ""harder"" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment"
1,"I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul"
4,"This album is a masterpiece by a legend who, at 65 years old, topped the charts. Dylan is an extroadinary talent and seems to get even better with age. Every song is exceptional and showcases his great talent and songwriting ability"
5,"I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a ""rock"" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a ""good"" song while Alex's delivery makes it a ""great"" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to ""get together"" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just ""meant"" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of ""Smooth"" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job."
5,"An outstanding set of kid's music with folk scene stalwarts such as Arlo Guthrie, Taj Mahal and Tim O'Brien joined by bluegrassers Tim O'Brien and Rhonda Vincent and blues pickers Keb Mo, Guy Davis and Eric Bibb, as well as Americana-country types such as Rosie Flores... An impressive lineup, sure, but better still is the calibre of songwriting, and the actual kid friendliness of it all.  This is a really fun album!  Fun, as in, little kids might actually like it, and might even sing along if you played it for them.  Plenty of silly songs like ""Bling-Blang,"" ""Bananaphone"" and ""Bellybutton Song.""  Some songs are perky, like ""Red, Red Robin""; others are instructive, like ""Man Named All The Animals,"" and others still model assertiveness and communication skills, like Taj Mahal's excellent ""Don't You Push Me Down,"" in which various kids stick up for themselves in unpleasant situations.  I like this album a lot, and plan to play it for my kid for years to come"
5,"You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr"
5,"In 1975, Joe Jackson was tired of Motown Records controlling his childrens' careers. So he moved them over to Epic Records. The newly Christened ""Jacksons"" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few.  They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, ""The Jacksons"" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with ""Enjoy Yourself"" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic ""Style Of Life"". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that ""Good Times"" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat"
5,"I am 68 and a long time Stewart fan, this is one of his best.  Don't know what the problem is with the other reviewers"
5,"What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in ""Power, Corruption Lies"" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.    The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for ""Blue Monday"" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  ""Age of Consent"" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also ""the Village""  is a great track as well.  If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!  -- Ted Murena   "
5,This CD is great for the entire family. The songs are catchy and it's not a big deal if you're caught singing them around strangers!
2,"I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's"
5,"I enjoy the album still to this day. All the songs are good, but I listen a couple of songs more than others such as Hold On, You don't have to worry, Don't Go.  This is a great album, which I don't planning on selling or trading anytime soon. "
5,The Crusaders Sound Great on this Disc.The Music&amp;Arrangements work very well all the way thru.The Grooves&amp;Smoothness make this Recording very Complete.this Group has been Bad for so long
5,"If it has the name Edwin McCain on it, trust me its a great product to buy. The songs he writes are heart felt and true to every drop of ink used to write them with.."
1,"Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.  If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.  Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately"
1,"I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree"
5,"Carbon Leaf's sound continues to evolve, and the results are outstanding. The band says it has given up trying to ""define"" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: ""Block of Wood"" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while ""International Airport"" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.  The songs range from engaging (""Bright Lights,"" ""Love Loss Hope Repeat"") to anthemic (""Learn to Fly,"" ""Comfort"") to heartbreaking (""Block of Wood"") to humorous (""A Girl and Her Horse"") to profound (""The War Was in Color""). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album.   There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.  This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with ""Ganging Up on the Sun"" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with ""Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat."
4,One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not  get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If  you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one  great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to  seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley
5,"This soundtrack is excellent. There is not a single song that I skip when listening to the cd.  The mix of recent and older songs sung by familiar and unfamiliar artists is great.  Anita Nalick, Breathe (2a.m.) is worth the price of the album."
5,"I haven't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there's online piracy? But I have to own this.  Feinstein's voice is so pure and versatile; he is funny at a moment and the next, he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet. His performance is first class, and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert.  "
4,"I have maybe a hundred Christmas CDs (it's a hobby) but I think this is the only one with the ""Explicit Lyrics"" warning!  This is fore just for one song ""Here Comes Fatty Claus"" which featured a fairly prominent use of the ""sh*t"" word.  I have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the CD without that song. She loves it!  As for the CD... it's pretty good. Waters has managed to collect the best of campy Christmas songs, something unique as far as I'm aware.    But it's not just a novelty CD... the songs are good. This isn't intentional camp... it is sincere stuff with MAYBE the exception of the Tiny Time song. (One of my daughter's favorite, because it's well done."
1,"As if Fiddy Cent wasn't enough to make me break some bones, this horrible trend of Kayne West comes in. What is there to be said that hasn't been said? Nothing, really; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers. All I have to say is that I hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later.  Want good rap? Go for Tupac (R.I.P.) or Public Enemy"
1,"Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty.  &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember"
5,"Dan Zanes is great! My husband and I both enjoy listening to this as well as our 20 month old. Most of the other music CD's that we have for our son I find a little irritating after a bit of listening. Rocket Ship Beach is fun, family music! I highly recommend this to all ages"
1,"Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In ""Preacher's Daughter"" he even says ""A preacher's daugher so she had common sense."" I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then ""Pass Me Over"" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. ""Sista Big Bones"" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this"
4,"Bubble from Ab Fab sounds exactly like Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and others.  What a talent.  She needs her own Las Vegas Show.  She would be beyond great!  "
5,"Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars."
5,"I'm one of those people who didn't really *know* anything about Beck.  Oh sure I knew his hits - ""Loser"", ""Where It's At"", ""The New Pollution"" et al.  Just never really thought much about the guy.  Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go...""E Pro"" and ""Girl"".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.  During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with ""Earthquake Weather"".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being ""meh"" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!  The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the ""Hey! Guero!"" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!  DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem"
5,"""Alt-country"" would indeed be a limiting description,none-the-less an accurate point of reference,as this artist is obviously drawing from past Country musicians.But make no mistake,this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.I'm usually more inclined towards the Heavy than the twangy,but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings,and this woman can SING.One of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation"
5,"After the profound impact of the David Rawlings produced ""O.C.M.S.,"" to my music collection, my pre-order of ""Big Iron World"" came with pretty high expectations. I've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it doesn't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of ""Wagon Wheel,"" ""Big Iron World"" does pull some wonderfully surprising punches. Though he doesn't capture OCMS's live act at it's fullest (and who really could), Rawlings' production once again manages to maintain OCMS's authenticity and pushes their ""old-time"" music into the modern area, without a hint of the tacky, over-produced, artificial, gimmicks, heard on other neo-bluegrass records.   ""Big Iron World"" is not an album stuck in history, or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past. With ""Big Iron World,"" OCMS once again displays its own sound, pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward, while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of Woody Guthrie, the picking of Muleskinner and the late 60's albums of Dylan. Moreover, the songs of ""Big Iron World"" comprise a complete body of work. The pro-union, ""Union Maid"" and folksy ""James River Blues"" are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole, with each song complementing the next. As with all of OCMS's albums, ""Big Iron World"" is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age.  They have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres."
5,"by far, Picture This, is my favorite cd from the JB collection...have three copies...one for the home, one for the car, and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts! Been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997...despite our daily hectic schedules, his music always brings us back to a place that is calm, relaxing & peaceful...now that we have small children, they are even accustomed to listening his music, which makes bedtime even sweeter! :)"
1,"You got to be kidding me right? People actually giving this album 5 stars. Wow people are so blind it isn't even funny. This is all commercialized garbage. E-40 is all on this ""hyphy"" tip now, lmao how wack is that. Hyphy is straight wack, the lyrics have no concept what so ever. All pointless.  Production, well yea all these commercialized albums got production, like this album. But then again where are the lyrics?   This is one of those albums where you sit there and like it ONLY because of the beat/hook lol. People that listen to this type of music dont like real Hip-Hop, as I said theyre blind. People that arent big Hip-Hop fans, I dont criticize you for listening, but all you people that claim to be Hip-Hop fans, f*** outta here, you aint.   This album is for commercial rap listeners only, if you like underground STAY away from this at all costs. Pick up some real HipHop instead.  Peace. "
2,"When I first bought this cd I really liked it, but unlike most other cd's it sounded worse with time. After 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and I found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the Killers. After seeing them live at the Virgin Festival this weekend I know they are totally phony, not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever. Do yourself a favor save your money on this one"
5,"When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert,      I like to listen to something quiet and soothing.  THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous ""Pizza boy"" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as ""background music.""  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.  By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)  I actually get the craving for pizza when I'm listening to the album.  The PIZZA TAPES sure is one tasty album. Great music and great pizza, what a winning combination!"
2,"Pls. Rick Nielsen, ""Tell Me Everything""! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's ""Mommy and Daddy"" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant!"
1,"I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon.  What a major disappointment this disk is.  Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good &quot;children's music&quot; inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk"
5,"I MUST SAY THAT WHEN I FIRST HEARD ""KICK PUSH"" I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT THIS GUY REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A METAPHORIC RHYMER AND HIS DELIVERY IS VERY STRONG SO I KNOW I HAD TO BUY LUPE FIASCO'S DEBUT ALBUM ""FOOD AND LIQUOR"". AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED BUT INDEED THIS ALBUM REALLY LET ME KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A FEW RAPPERS OUT THERE THAT ARE STILL KICKING RHYMES ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH IN EVERYDAY LIFE INSTEAD OF HEARING THESE OTHER MC'S THAT DONT RAP ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT CARS, CLOTHES, JEWELRY, AND WOMEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS A FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE THIS ALBUM WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS IN LIFE.  MY 5 FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: 1.""THE COOL""- THIS SONG IS BASICALLY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD DIED(NOT LITERALLY) BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE AND TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CHOSE TO LIVE HIS LIFE THE SAME WAY HE HAD LIVED IT ONCE BEFORE. SONG IS VERY METAPHOR AND DEEP. 2.""HE SAY SHE SAY""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESNT HAVE A VISIBLE FATHER AND IT IS AFFECTING HIM DEEPLY. 3.""HURT ME SOUL""- THIS SONG TALKS JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF FROM WOMEN BEING DEGRADED IN RAP MUSIC, DRUG DEALING, CROOKED COPS, GOVERNMENT NOT OFFERING BLACK PEOPLE WELFARE AND OVERCHARGING HEALTHCARE, JOHNS AND PROSTITUTES. SONG ALSO HAS A VERY NICE HOOK. 4.""SUNSHINE""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IN A CLUB EVENTHOUGH HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE HE CANNOT RESIST IT WITH THIS GIRL. 5.""PRESSURE"" FEATURING JAY-Z- VERY NICE CONCEPT TO IT FROM LUPE'S STANDPOINT AND EVENTHOUGH IM NOT A BIG JAY-Z FAN HE STILL PUT DOWN A NICE VERSE.  OTHER SONGS I LIKE ARE ""JUST MIGHT BE OK"", ""DAYDREAMININ"", ""KICK PUSH"", ""I GOTCHA"",""INSTRUMENTAL"", AND ""AMERICAN TERRORISTS"".  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL!!!!"
5,"I can't rate this one highly enough. It's certainly in a vein with his last couple, but, as has been oft noted, it's more political and full of social commentary. Some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones, as a result. I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs.  By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book ""Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music."" It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana. And Rodney shows up prominently throughout the book; there's a whole section just about this album"
1,"I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was ""Grind With Me"" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.  I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond ""Baby Blue"", and Slick -- and I use the term ""rapper"" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single ""Grind With Me"" is really called ""Grind On Me"", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but ""Playhouse"" isn't far behind. And ""Nothing But a Number"" is very, very statutory.  Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like ""If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right"" on ""Grind On Me"", or ""If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'"" on ""Grill `Em"" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like ""FROM THE BACK!"" on ""Get a Little Closer"", and ""Yes, sir!"" on ""Your Body"". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on ""Shorty Be Mine"" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.  Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on ""Never Let You Go"", ""Can't Live Without You"", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs ""Chevy"" and ""Grill `Em"". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of ""Your Body"", dammit, I'll beat it up.  Anthony Ruper"
5,"Wow...what a great collection of songs, a wonderful album. I am a fan of the Church, but even if you have never heard of them, you will find this disc amazing. I am at a loss of words to decribe the songs. My only regret is that there is not a DVD of performances of these songs. I would go upstairs and watch it all night"
5,Really well done. This is an extremely well crafted CD. Six Days is probably the best song on here.  Note: The song when they're waiting for bow wow's car is       Ooh Aah - Grit
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. "
2,"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just ""a little slow"" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and ""deep"", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty.     "
2,"I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2."
2,"I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation ""i'm your man"" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of ""if it be your will"" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. ""If It be your will"" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. ""mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ."" or ""i am so very happy, so please hit me"" or ""river of sorrow, don't swallow"" or the breathy way he says the word ""twilight"" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says ""if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people"". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved ""if it be your will"" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort."
2,"Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him"
1,"I don't care what others stated...Sabata rushed the opera to fit the LP capability, Maria screamed at all times, no pianissimis, and everyone was super high charged like they must finish the recording on time to fit the album.  Best Tosca is Maria Callas with Pretre recording.  Don't buy this mono recording.  Maria did not understand who Tosca was during this moment"
2,"Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me.  A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying.  Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad.  I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.    But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible.  They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.  Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times"
1,"perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched"
5,I love this new CD from Amos Lee.    The first single is entitled Shout Out Loud.  This song really puts me in a great mood.  His guitar playing is so energetic here.  My favorite track is Long Line Of Pain though.  It is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness. Sympathize is an another highlight on this disc.  Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck.  Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the  charm of a girl from the south.  Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one.  Freedom is an interesting track.  It is a reminder that the pursuit of  freedom should not lead to violence.  The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special.  Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend.  I love the feeling of loss and sense of  hurt in Amos' voice on this track.   Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer
2,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD"
5,"Once again, Audra McDonald proves that she's the best musical theatre singer since Streisand. While many fans might quibble with her selections (mostly covers of rock and pop songs), her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none"
2,"Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector.  The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable.  Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off.  Even Robin's latest redition ""A Live CD"" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies.  And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family.  Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers.  So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.  A devoted listener talisman, Dundee "
1,"The Black Eyed Peas are the WORST group is rap HISTORY! Its hard to believe that anyone could make music worse than the Black Eyed Peas. This group is an embarasment to Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and any other type of music ever created. How and why people continue to support these lame, extremely non-talented rejects of the rap world is completely unbelievable. I thought thier last CD was trash, but this has incredibly surpassed the low mark set by Elephunk, which should have been called, ""Hey let'sell out and attempt to create the worst music ever known to man"". The only good news is that theyll soon be forgotten about as they have just murdered thier musical careers, and will have to resort to doing jingles for commmercials in order to survive. These three unoriginal, talentless, boring, annoying, sellout, fake wanna-bes should stop making ANY kind of music and get completely out of the music business. Tonight I willl pray very hard that these bafoons of the music industry NEVER make another song EVER!!!! To say that they SUCK would be a compliment, they would have to practice constantly for the next 1,000 years THEN make a deal with the devil just to scrape up enough talent to suck! Theyre just that HORRIBLE!!"
1,"Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as ""Ray."").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie ""Ray.""  And to anyone who says that he can write good songs, let's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics:   Yo you sleep  Naw I just um, I think I want some more  Yea I know we just got through  But its just so good, I just caint help it tho'  Its something about your body  Naw it aint all I think about  Well to be honest, oh   Im startin' to believe,  Something's wrong wit me,  Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute  I'm thinkin' `bout it  I can be at my job, in my car, up in church  And when I try to pray it off, it won't work  It seems that I caint get enough of   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Its getting to the point where I (where I)  I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs  Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)  I aint proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me  And I caint help it, caint shake it  (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Some call it bad, some call it good  Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood  I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh   Some like it slow, some like it fast  It don't matter the tempo long as it lasts  I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh    -Wow, that's a big pile of garbage!  Lyrics like that should easily win him a Grammy.  Keep it up, Jamie! "
2,"There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow ""Singin in the Bathtub"" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time"
5,"Like all of Antony's Music, this EP has a chilling and superhuman quality to it. Unlike his other stuff, the production is toned down on the non-album tracks (""The Lake"" and ""The Horror Is Gone"") to a stark, white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of Antony & The Johnsons. The album track, ""Fistful of Love"", is one of my favourite Antony songs, a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish.  Though the price is a bit steep, this is a great addition to any Antony fan's library"
4,"I am not a CLAY-MATE... howver, Clay Aiken is without-a-doubt the best runner-up from any season of AI.  That being said...I still wasn't sure if I would like this CD.  And I didn't---at first.  But then, after hearing it a few more times, I actually grew to like most of the songs.  Not all of them, which is why I didn't give him 5 stars, but it is a very good album.  My favorite happens to be the title track.  But, there are several more good songs on the CD.  Whether or not you are into this style of music, you can't argue that Clay Aiken has one of the best male voices around.  Probably the best male voice of his age.  I would recommend this CD to any one who is into Adult Contemporary.  Of course, if you are a Clay-mate, then I don't have to tell you anything :"
1,"As a big fan of the Postal Service (their ""Give Up"" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)""Last Songs"" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service"
4,"This is a very different sounding Paul Simon album.  The influence of Brian Eno is obvious and at times over-the-top.  My conclusion, now that I've had this album for a while, is that it's not one that I'm constantly listening to but, when I'm in the mood, this is really an interesting and fun album.  Occasionally, Paul reaches heights I don't feel he's reached since Graceland.  There are some great songs on here.  If you're looking for ""Still Crazy after all these years"" or ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" - type songs, you're not going to find them here.  If you're interested in hearing Paul push the envelope, however, this is the one.  Paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one"
1,"I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the ""look at it a week from now and see how you feel"" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it."
2,"I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art.  People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages.  They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks.  Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears.  To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.    I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.  Creative; maybe.  Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no"
1,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience"
1,"Boy, and I thought ""Cats"" was bad. This is the single most boring, stupid, pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears. There is no story line, no range in music, no feeling, no lyrics to back up the awful music. I mean, the list could go on forever. I warn you, it's the biggest waste of $25.00 that you might, no, will ever spend. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and trust me. DON""T BUY THE CD!!! And if you do, when you put it on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.You've been warned. Now please, spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life"
5,"If you like this album, if you like the title track, it might inspire a few hard core fans to know that the original inspiration for both the name of the band, and especially the title track, is the masterpiece of a western, ""Bad Company""- 1972.  The whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film's soundtrack, by ""Fantasticks"" Harvey Schmidt.  The song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until I saw the film itself.  It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges.  It's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination, but to fans of the band itself, to help make the song more meaningful, as it has for me!!  I highly recommend them both"
5,"I have held back from doing an online review because I recognize that my objectivity isn't well, very objective when it comes to Elton John.  I love everything he does (even ""Victim of Love""!).  But I could no longer resist.  This CD is magnificent.  Elton John and Bernie Taupin have crafted a work that spans generations, bridges gaps and even pays homage to personal and artistic lapses over the years.  It is an honest, courageous and celebratory reflection of the terrain these two geniuses have traversed over some 37 years.  That's the depth of ""The Captain and the Kid.""  But let's not get lost in the depths here, either.  This CD is one great listen.  Even if you're not interested in the history...even if you're just a casual fan (can one just be a casual Elton John fan??)  or just like good music, ""The Captain and the Kid"" is great entertainment.  It has it all...great arrangements, great piano playing from Elton and of course, hooks abound.  No one...that's right, no one can write a hook like Elton.  These songs stay with you...they become your companions on YOUR journey, and like good wine, they get better and better.  I must also write a word of support for all who have written regarding so many artists doing retreads of old standards/hits.  I know, I know, this stuff is selling like there's no tomorrow.  I suppose, as much as I can't bear another Rod Stewart retread CD ( I loved Rod though most of his career...I just can't stand what he's done over the last five years...Rod...please STOP!) I guess the attraction/appeal of these CD's is that the buyer knows they're going to get a full CD's worth of good (or at least known) songs from a reliable artist.  True, it is not as easy as it used to be to find many CD's today that are original and good from start to finish...CD's tend to be longer than LP's and therefore run the risk of running out of steam, and let's face it...many do. Oh, the classic CD's, they're out there, you might have to do some mining before striking gold, however.  Sadly, ""The Captain and the Kid"" did not ignite the charts.  I cannot understand it. And I do realize that popularity has nothing to do with greatness. Yet, this IS truly a great CD, a work of art that deserves to be heard.  It is a throw back to the glory days, yet it is not dated in the least. And one listen...just one puts you right back on the yellow brick road, platform shoes and all! No, I suppose you can't go back...not totally anyway, but it is oh so nice take one more sweet ride with The Captain and the Kid. "
1,Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others
2,"Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut ""Lucky To Know You.""  ""Seeing Through You"" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like ""Lucky To Know You."" "
4,"Be Human does not disappoint! It has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when I say 4stars I mean it. When I say 5stars I usually mean a ten. Were I to do sound for a futuristic play I would feel gratified in using some of this. I think Yoko Kanno knows the Secret of Life and she shares her formula...with us, time-and-time again. I happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces; but if I had to choose american rhythm or Yoko Kanno, I would choose Yoko Kanno. I wonder if she's ever been nominated for a grammy? In my book she's world-class!As-I-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify  four-stars. No worries here"
5,This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio
1,This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.  He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.  I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable
2,"I have always liked R. Kelly's music.  When he produced ""Trapped in the Closet"", I thought it was a joke.  This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard."
2,"Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  ""Get Your Hustle On"" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  ""I Know You Know"" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  ""Around The Way"" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  ""Sets Go Up"" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single ""Rodeo"" is the millennium version of ""Back That [...] Up"" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  ""What's Happenin'"" is nothing to write home about, ""Loose Booty"" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and ""Break A Brick Down"" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. ""Who's Ya Daddy"" is pointless, along with the annoying ""Keep Talkin'"" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and ""Why Not.""  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on ""Rock Like That.""  The biggest shocker has to be ""Addicted"" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of ""The Rain."")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come. "
2,"There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.  Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.  The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).  Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).  P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter. "
1,"BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!!"
1,"I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song ""Good is Good"" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned ""crimes"" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some ""SOUL."" Peace"
1,"And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of ""covers"" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' ""First Utterance,"" the Incredible String Band's ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" or Shirley Collins' ""No Roses"" instead"
5,"This album showcases Collin Raye's amazing tenor to the fullest. Hits like ""Love Me,"" ""Little Rock,"" ""My Kind of Girl,"" ""Not That Different,"" and ""I Can Still Feel You"" are featured on this brilliant album. Raye's vocals are well done, as is the song selection. Most of the songs are ballads, Raye's specialty. If you are a fan of Collin Raye, then this album is a must-have."
1,"I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a ""hip hop teeny bopper"". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should"
5,"Though Dylan and the Band had played together a lot before this record (the Basement tapes and the 1967 tour), this is the first recording of them together that was released and I must say the Band's playing on this record is vastly different than those times, different than the live ""Before the Flood"" as well. I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work. Love songs, dirges, uplifting songs, tough songs and torch songs, this is a record for the ages. Yes, it was overshadowed by ""Blood on the Tracks,"" but it's been years now and still ""Planet Waves"" stands the test of time. I really like this record"
1,"Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style."
1,"Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why ""remake"" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to ""No More Kings"" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!"
1,"Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this"
1,"What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review"
5,"If you are looking for just a general overview of Iggy's career, I'd say this is a pretty good way to go.  It contains a bit of music from each section of his career"
5,"This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the ""Titanic"" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: ""National Treasure Suite"" (Track 1). The Tracks: ""Library of Congress"" (Track 4), and ""Declaration of Independence"" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: ""Spectacle Discovery"" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money"
5,This CD is a must have if you are a Hot Boys (Old school Cash Money) fan
2,"...don't buy this CD.  Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy.  There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan.  It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well.  The upsides to this compilation are as follows:  one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive.  However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all"
