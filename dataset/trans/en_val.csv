5,"Time Without Consequence is one of those albums. One of the ones that you can put into your cd player and just feel completely enveloped by the music. The quiet, gentle intensity of this album is just outstanding. Murdoch seems to be singing/playing so effortlessly and at the same time pouring his entire soul into the music. It is a dichotomy that is present throughout the entire album and it works extremely well.   The comparisons between Murdoch and Nick Drake are valid, and that is actually the first time I've said that, which is amazing considering how many artists people compare to Nick Drake. The biggest similarity between the two is the quiet intensity they bring to their music. But Murdoch goes beyond Nick Drake in the sense that he is not just a Drake clone, and his songs showcase Murdoch's own identity and direction.   I won't go into individual songs, because I'm sure others will review the album song by song. I'll just say that I although I have my favorites, there aren't any bad songs on this album. All the songs are quality pieces of music and none deserve to be skipped over. This will probably be the top album of the year for me, and it is definitely the best I've heard so far. Great music."
5,"This album is Sting's prophetic masterpiece, a brilliant work of rocknroll genius with a soul, a conscience, and some of the most powerful, beautiful songs written. In this ablum Sting addresses crucial political issues of our time, and timeless subjects like love, redemption, war, and more, in poetry that ranks with the very best. Like others, I loved Dream of the Blue Turtles and Nothing Like the Sun, but Sacred Love truly surpasses them in its depth, maturity, passion, varied range and lyrical beauty. This is as good as rock gets, and it rarely gets close to this good. That said, ""Sacred Love"" may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues Sting takes on here, and to the new territory he is exploring through his art. And it may go over the heads of those who don't want rock and roll to challenge them, musically, politically or spiritually. Thank God for artists like Sting who follow their muse with unwavering integrity and let the chips fall where they may"
1,"The power of marketing behind Mrs. Souza is incredible! Her previous album, Brazilian Duos, was listed among the Best Jazz Albums of 2001 by New York Times - a critic, Mr. Ben Ratliff, had received an advance CD copy and included the album on his list, although the album only would be officially released in April 2002...Strange? Well, the next year the same Mr. Ratliff, in the same NY Times, included the same CD in his Best Jazz Albums of 2002 list...Then, &quot;Brazilian Duos&quot; got a Grammy nomination in March 2003...And now, in a few days, this horrible &quot;North and South&quot; CD will receive a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album...No more comments"
5,"There is not much to say about this album that has not been said already.  It was the first of many albums that solidified the jump of the british psychadelic band pink floyd into the worldwide limelight, unsurpassed Jagernaut that it became.  It has a very timeless sound, and flows effortlessly from one song to another and just takes you through an unsurpassed journey from beginning to end.  Time, Money, Us and Them, and Brain Damage are my amongt my top 20 floyd songs of all time.  If you need to own one floyd album, it should be this album.  Pallatable to all old fans, and to new ones. "
4,this is a well done soundtrack...my only complaint about it is that the violin parts can get a bit tedious...but I guess they are really good because I didn't  even notice them when I saw the movie...so...overall...very good! ...also a very creepy them
5,"Fleetwood Mac in the 70's and early 80's were the biggest band on the planet. With a new line-up that included Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham they owned the music world. Rumors is still on the top 5 best sellers of all-time. This compilation includes all their hits and some rare gems as well. Silver Springs was recorded during the Rumors sessions. Stevie Nicks asked if she could use the song for a solo album. Mick Fleetwood did not allow her to use the song. It was later recorded for the Dance and became a major hit for them in the 90's The version you hear on this compilation is the one recorded for Rumors in the 70's Its almost frightening that a song this good was not included on Rumors. Fleetwood Mac continues to tour and record and still makes great music. This is for the serious Fleetwood Mac fan who wants to hear rare gems, and cant not get enough of their classic songs"
5,"Oh my goodness....I had this on a vinyl LP back when I was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents CRAZY with it. I listened to it 3 times a day for about two years....about 700 times or more...when I was 14 and 15.  Now that I listen to it again, I see it was terribly formative for me, a major influence on my life.  I never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now, miles away, years later....Buy this and it will change your life"

1,"A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: &quot;paper or plastic?&quot"
5,"As a completist Gram fan since 1969, the alternate versions of We'll Sweep Out the Ashes, Streets of Baltimore, and Hickory Wind are truly otherworldly.  Well worth the price, in and of themselves"
5,"I was too young to be in love at that time but I remember jamming to "" No More Lies"" on the radio. In fact, I enjoy the whole album, and listen to them all except ""If"" and ""Special Thanks"" - her squeaky voice cracks me up"
1,"This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on ""Happiness"" or ""Spiritual Machines"" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record"
5,"Michael Giacchino's score for Mission: Impossible 3 is an excellent blend of action music and a grat adaption of Schiffen's classic music.  As he did with the Incredibles, Giacchino shows the ability to write a classic score that fits perfectly with the film and stands up well on its own.  Probably the best of the three Mission scores.  Elfman's matched his own style, Zimmer's matched his, but Giacchino's matched Mission:Impossibles"
5,"From the pop title track, a duet with Kid rock protege Uncle Kracker,to the heartstring tug of There goes my life, this album has great range and thoughtful lyrics which are absent in many other genres. Chesney is perfectly positioned to become a crossover star, earning the status  more from his music than his pretty boy image. Aside from the title track, most songs refreshingly veer from his beachcombing, young jimmy Buffet beach anthems that are characteristic of his earlier work"
1,"Here, in all their glory, is REM: the undisputed Pied Pipers of the bedwetters.  While Michael Stipe's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a German Stuka dive-bomber, the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere.  In REM, we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying.  The embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in 1992, but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate.  This album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift"
5,"""Honky Chateau"" is an example of why Greatest Hits albums just do not work for great artists. This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. ""Rocket Man"" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. ""Honky Cat"" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his ""redneck ways"" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song ""Mellow"", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice ""You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow"" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in ""I think I am going to Kill Myself"" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of ""Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues"", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with ""I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way"" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. ""Amy"" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice ""Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams"". One of the ultimate classics is ""Mona Lisa"" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings ""Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you"" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, ""Hercules"" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a ""cat named Hercules"".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. ""Rocket Man"" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding ""Slave"" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable.          "
2,"High record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned. Blur became household names in Britain because of this album, especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle ""Parklife"", but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band: it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer Damon Albarn's mental breakdown.   But what did they expect? This is , after all, the album that summed up Britain's geezer culture: where men are men and women act like men as well. Where the Thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away, and it's okay to Look After Number 1 and act like a bit or a moron. This album, for better or worse (in my opinion, worse) is more representative of Britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else. If you're American and still think that Britain is all Hugh Grants and tea on the village green, forget it. And here's the proof.  The album itself is cheerful enough, but totally uninspired. It bears none of the influence from American acts of the 80s and 90s, like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, the Meat Puppets or Dinosaur Jr., or Brit acts like My Bloody Valentine. Guitarist Graham Coxon's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs, because they're written by Albarn. Just tunes, many of which are distinctly ordinary. Even much-lauded songs like ""This Is a Low"" are let-downs, because they don't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the Beatles or the Kinks. Indeed, Blur are just like a modern Kinks. Just without the great songs.  It's sad that with this album, Blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said. Modern life IS rubbish"
1,I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede
1,"Dont buy this CD. I dont know what all the hype is about, but boy was I fooled. The lyrics and the flow are below average, and yeah, there are some weird sounds in there, but the beats are nothing special either. I bought this, put it in my car, and within a couple songs I had to turn it off. I tried the next day, same thing. There is a lot of good underground hip-hop out there, so buy some of it instead"
5,"Psychedelia and hip-hop. Those are two words I never thought I'd be relating when referring to one of my favorite albums of 2005. I still can't get over it. What a phenomenal idea. The Boston based rapper Edan possesses more than just an untouchable flow. He's also the producer, programmer, engineer, sampler...you name it, he does it all. The production held within is bafflingly perfect. He's successfully brought the feel of a 60s psychedelic record to the form of hip-hop, including the concept. Clocking in at roughly 34 minutes (as most 60s psychedelic records run), there is absolutely no wasted space. This is an album of epic proportions that rides the line of psychedelia and hip-hop cleaner than you can imagine. It's almost puzzling that a hip-hop record including heavy influence of The Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"", The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", or Pink Floyd's ""Piper At The Gates Of Dawn"" would come off as such a cohesive set of gems. But it does, and Edan proves he's the man for the job.  The album's intro, ""Polite Meeting Intro"", starts it off with some music that could be from Sponge Bob Squarepants, then with the addition of trippy sound effects and vintage English vocal samples, we end up in The Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"". It sets it off nicely. Then comes ""Funky Voltro"" featuring Insight, which includes a high-pitched swooping Minimoog played by Edan, and also a funky guitar sample. Then comes ""I See Colours"", a clear standout featuring a synthesizer played by Edan. Edan proves to have a impenetrable flow here, boasting some imaginative lyrics that work very well with the sweet atmospheric soundscapes and soothing 60s vocal and guitar samples. The next cut, ""Fumbling Over Words That Rhyme"", is also one of my favorites. Edan pays homage to some of the great innovators in hip-hop, including Run D.M.C., Grandmaster Flash Flash, Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Nas and Ultramagnetic MC's among others. It seems that a lot of rappers tend to make an ""homage"" to old-school emcees, but Edan simply does it better by explaining ""why"" they were true innovators, which is much better in the eyes of this reviewer. ""Murder Mystery"" is a sweet track with some music similar to Jimi Hendrix's ""Are You Experienced"" with that reverse rhythm, then cuts in with instrumentation that sounds like it could be from the old ""Odd Couple"" tv show. The next cut, ""Torture Chamber"" featuring flows by Percee P, speeds things up with a dirtier beat, orchestra string arrangements, and a background Pink Floyd sample from ""Dark Side Of The Moon"". Then comes the best collaborative effort on the album; ""Making Planets"" featuring Mr. Lif. Lif was actually the one who turned me on to Edan, as he was featuring on Lif's ""Emergency Rations"" EP and his critically acclaimed ""I Phantom"". The production is especially creepy here, as Lif jumps in towards the end at the climax of the song. ""Time Out (Segue)"" is a tripped out interlude that blends perfectly to the next superior cut, ""Rock and Roll"" featuring Dagha. Which features some cool crunching guitars in it's very memorable production. I also love this lyric - ""My mental fabric / to big for Lenny Kravitz / Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facet"". ""Beauty"" is up next. This song is really one of my favorites. Like it's title, the soulful production is beautiful. The addictive reverse rhythm, tight drum loops, and soaring flute makes it a huge standout. I also love this lyric - ""I use pens like hallucinogens"". It mixes beautifully into ""The Science of the Two"" featuring Insight once again. This is another one of my favorites (it just keeps getting better as it goes). ""Smile"" is one of the trippier tracks on the album. He couldn't have closed out the album better, than with ""Promised Land"", definitely a standout. It's got a very memorable production, and some sick lyrical spitting from the one, the only, Edan.  I see some people complaining about the short run time (34 minutes). I on the other hand, think it's perfect. There is so much filler in today's hip-hop (underground included), that it's nice to have 13 powerful, memorable, carefully crafted tracks to concentrate on. I've spent most of my teen years listening to 60s and 70s psychedelic records, along with a wide array of classic rock, so it may be a bit more intriguing to me than the next hip-hop head, but this stuff is truly unique. Edan may have been paying tribute to hip-hop's greatest innovators lyrically, but he's also paid tribute to 60s and 70s psychedelia in one of the most memorable ways possible; through hip-hop"
5,"For whatever reason I bought this album much later on than the other two English Beat albums - something about it &quot;not being as good&quot;. That's complete nonsense. This album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later, after the fact as it were. There's not a weak track on this CD. Plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound. &quot;Dreamhome in NZ&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Murders&quot; are lost 80's classics to go along with the better-known &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot;. Love the alternate version of &quot;Get-A-Job&quot; found here. I rank this second Beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to &quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;; it's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll. Looking back, I wish the English Beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like &quot;Wha'ppen?&quot;. They probably do too"
4,"Though John Mayer is new to me, I have always liked the 'soft rock' genre. I got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections, (especially 'Clarity') and listening to the lyrics came later.   John Mayer...easy on my ears. I'll try another CD. I think this music could grow on me."
2,"I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said ""If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"" "

5,"Veteran rocker Joe Grushecky is back with a new CD, entitled A Good Life. In an age where there's possible instant fame with TV shows and slick videos, Grushecky did it the old fashioned way: grinding it out in clubs and theatres over the years. Starting 25 years ago with his band, The Iron City Houserockers, Grushecky's always been part working class hero & part philosopher. It's a combination that has held up over time and this new CD is full of tunes that will make you think as well as crank up the stereo. Gary Borress, NY"
2,"I'm sure this won't win me any popular votes but, this musical is one that I feel I have to comment on. What has happened to Broadway? Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as ""Little Women.""  As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as ""The Secret Garden"" or ""Jane Eyre."" But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.  The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions ""Take A Chance On Me"" and ""Small Umbrella In The Rain"" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.   The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.  It's obvious why when you listen to ""Little Women""- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else.."
