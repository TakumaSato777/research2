5,"It is ""Yumegen"" which contains all single songs. I had not checked out any of Nana's new songs recently, so I was surprised to hear that she was going to cover Yumegen by Inyoza. I was surprised to hear that she was going to cover Yumegen by Yinyoza (lol). The first song ""Yumegen"" is similar to ""Shin'ai"", but I can feel Nana's mature and sexy side. The second song, ""Canary in the Sky,"" is an authentic, fast-running number. If you like ""Gaia of Afterglow,"" you will probably like this song. The third song, Dear Dream, is most recommended! It will cheer you up when you listen to it while driving from morning to afternoon. The fourth track, STORIES, is a ballad used in ekiden (relay races). The jacket is also well done and Nana-san in the first limited live photo is cute. Nana-san was also appointed as a cheering group for Kohaku. I will continue to support you!"
2,"I can't say...it's really hard to put into words...but...it's not very good!"" I'm really sorry to the people inside and Kazu-chan fans including myself (apologies). I was secretly expecting Kazu-chan. I was secretly expecting Kazu-chan to be the cool, breezy, bespectacled beauty that she is in the anime. I am sure it was difficult to make Kaz-chan cool. Yes, it was decided so! She was such a perfect image in the anime, but unfortunately I couldn't conjure up the image of Kazu-chan in the song for me. 'Coolly Hotty Tension Hi! but the lyrics are also different from the image of Kazu-chan... or is it that Kazu-chan has a strong gap between the two inside? 'Prologue' is a slow-tempo song. This one is still closer to the first song...but still, Kaz-chan's image...I thought of the old Aya Hisakawa...(lol) Like with Mugi-chan, Kaz-chan's songs are also very Showa-era. I am a little disappointed that there is no ""Let's Go""."
1,"I hope she will do well in her acting career alone. She was very good when she was playing roles in ""kowaii fairy tales"" and ""bad onna (bad girl)"". I wish you would stop thinking that if you release a CD, it will sell."
4,"I was told before I ordered that it was a studio recording, so I wasn't that disappointed. I was still hoping for a song from a rehearsal, but the sound quality had improved, so I was happy. But where was the bilingual translation for the first pressing? I felt it was fine without the bilingual translation as far as I could see from the booklet. So, I recommend you to buy this imported version."
5,"I am not a person who cares much about music, and this CD was recommended to me by someone, so I started to listen to it without much thought, but I never realized how beautiful her voice is! The CD contains 19 well-known songs such as the theme song of the movie ""Amalfi"", ""Titanic"", ""Turandot"", etc. After I finished listening to the CD, I felt very tender. I recommend it."
5,"As stated in many customer reviews, this is a masterpiece that will be listened to forever. This digitally remastered version in particular has greatly improved sound quality and is well worth the extra money. (The digital remastering technology is spectacular. How many times have I been forced to buy the same album!)"
1,"Since J SOUL BROTHERS album was so good, I am disappointed to see EXILE absorbing it, since I have high expectations for the future. To tell the truth, I think EXILE has already reached a boiling point. In such a situation, if a junior group with high skills like J SOUL BROTHERS comes out, I thought EXILE would be a great success, but they should not lose there, and let us think ""7 members of EXILE vs 7 members of J SOUL BROTHERS, still EXILE is the champion! 〜I'm sure they must make me think ""EXILE is the champion! Maybe they thought J SOUL BROTHERS could surpass them? Personally, I was looking forward to the future growth of SHOKICHI and NESMITH as twin vocalists, but I'm super shocked. It's like a bunch of company employees who can only do what the boss wants them to do. Sabu."
5,"I bought this because I loved the songs inserted in Code Geass. All the songs were great. When I want to listen to something alone, I can listen to this album comfortably without getting bored."
2,"GEASS: One Hundred Stories"" I enjoyed this episode as one of the festive episodes that the student council members enjoyed together, which was not shown on TV. ""Rebel Academy, Mr. Geass!"" Parallel, outlandish storyline requires a very interesting scenario... I felt that too many characters were introduced in the short 10-minute episode. It would have been better if the confrontation between the teacher and the last boss was more fun."
1,"This is a release of the album Amarantine from 2005 with a booklet and three cards in a red box. The CD itself is nothing new, the book, the three cards, and the box are the only differences from the previous album. I bought it without checking it carefully, but I wish a word of explanation had been put on the website. I have the 2005 CD, so .................................."
2,"The line with his own lyrics also seemed to be a bit stuck in a rut. I got tired of the similar melodies and lyrics after listening to them a few times. I think it would be a good idea to try singing a song written by someone else, instead of sticking to the original lyrics. I think it would be a good idea. I am a fan of the past, but I hope you will still try various things. I am looking forward to your next work."
5,"Emotions flow out of me every time I listen to it. Tears flood my eyes, not logic. It is good to live by beliefs, but I want to choose to live by my emotions."
4,"I was able to read by ear the world's old stories that I used to read when I was a little girl. And if it was a wonderful voice, the world of the story seemed to unfold before my eyes. Personally, I bought it because I like Kenichi Suzumura, but all the voice actors were wonderful in their own way. I was drawn into all 10 episodes because they were all nostalgic and fun. Music is great, but when I heard the stories that I have known and loved for a long time read aloud, I was reminded once again of the power of books (written and passed down from generation to generation). A good voice has a healing effect, so when I was tired or depressed, I just listened to the stories and felt like I was waiting for more. Ten episodes on one sheet - The King's Ears are Donkey Ears (Kenichi Suzumura) - Oin Og and the Mermaid (Daisuke Ono) - Let bygones be bygones (Katsuyuki Konishi) - The Flute Blower of Hamelin (Ryutaro Okiayu) - Aladdin and the Magic Lamp (Junichi Suwabe) - The Mountain Monster Peep Pantin (Tomokazu Sugita) - Honest Young Man and Cat (Shotaro Morikubo) （Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves (Daisuke Kishio) - The Prince of Happiness (Tetsuya Kakihara) - The Sword in the Stone (Hikaru Midorikawa) I hope they continue with the second and third installments, so I'll give it 4 stars with high hopes..."
5,"At this time, Michael was about 20 years old, I think, and had completely moved on from the cute voice of the Jackson 5, and was working in earnest as a funky black singer. As the main vocalist on this album, his voice is raw and punchy enough without relying on mechanical techniques. I think Michael Jackson from this period to ""Thriller"" is the best as an adult Michael Jackson."
2,"The style of the songs lately has been all pop and happy songs, which is atrocious. It's a reasonable song considering it's a tie-up, but I'd like to see them finish a song as good as ""Reserves"" with the original I've style."
4,"I think this is the best song among the new animations for September and October. The Japanese version is also included, which is also good, but the English version, which is more familiar to me, fits better. The ED is also a great song, so how about sharing it with us?"
5,"When I listen to this song, I feel very energetic. I think this song reminds me once again that Nana Mizuki is a really good singer."
2,"Anyway, the sound is too distorted.... Nana's voice is already sounding so ugly. I'm not an audiophile, and I'm not listening with an expensive system, but it's so clearly distorted that it's hard to listen to. I'm not an audiophile and I don't have an expensive system, but it's just too distorted and hard to listen to. The songs are good, really."
1,What do you want to be? You should be reborn at this point. You have to change. You'll never be the same.
1,"It's amazing that you can put one song on one CD. It's tough being a core fan. I know B'z from the small review in Guitar Magazine when they released their 1st album, and the one song one coin single with REAL.... The benefit service spirit of the first two albums made me think, ""Great job. You take care of your fans."" I bought them without thinking. Well, I'm sure they know it won't be taken in a good way. This is definitely the policy of the office and the record company (or is it the same?). They could have done something better, even though they did a good job in the 90's with the low-priced single bests of their artists (or was that a different company?). Why didn't they just release the single after this? But then they wouldn't have made any money (lol). Well, I'll buy the 2CD+DVD and rent the 3CD."
2,"Less than 4 years after the last BEST, this time it's not BEST, but ALL. What is the significance of releasing this ""ALL"" album? The contents seem to have been crammed into the album. And don't even get me started on the ""first pressing limited edition with a-tara"". It is a complete mockery of the fans. Compared to their attitude of valuing their live performances and fans, I feel a huge discrepancy in the way they release their CDs these days. Maybe we, the fans, who blindly buy every time a CD is released, are also at fault. The Vermilion label is a private label, so it is a shame if this is the way the two artists themselves are doing things. I hope it is the staff's way, not their own. B'z's CDs have the world record on the line, and I think the record is more important than the songs or the music. Is that really the way it should be?"
1,"Well, I won't quit being a B'z fan just because of this, but since I am a B'z fan, let me say this... Do you want money that bad, Being?"
4,"Rina Aiuchi's double A-side singles, ""Friend"" and ""Bare Faces"" ""Friend"" is a catchy number that sings about the importance of friendship and the unchanging things we can believe in. The new songs are good, but the way they sell the three singles... ""Friend"" with DVD, ""Today is the day Performed by INTER-D"" on the standard disc A, and ""If my wish comes true"" on the standard disc B. This avex-like way of selling is not like GIZA. This kind of avex-like sales is not like GIZA. I was a little disappointed this time... I'm hoping for the next one, so I gave it 4 stars!"
5,"At the time of its release, I felt that the album had become rather stripped-down, but listening to it now, it's not so bad. Quincy's spice is also very effective. I think this is an album that tends to get sidelined in the shadow of Thriller and Dangerous, but because of that, I think it is an album with a lot of rediscoveries."
1,"The strategy is too obvious... It's not as good as Yuji Oda's cover. I don't need to compare, but BoA's LAST CHRISTMAS was much better."
1,"I have been a fan of EXILE since chapter 1 and well supported chapter 2. To be honest, I was dismayed by the last album, but I was also dismayed at myself for buying it for some reason. My impression after buying it and listening to all the songs 3 times. To be honest, I think this CD deserves to be called ""Scars of EXILE"". Even if it is just a ""cover of the first chapter"", it is fatal to ""cover a famous song of Southern"" when it was criticized by the fans. It is fatal to ""cover Southern's masterpieces"". I compared the original and the cover of ""Midsummer's Fruit,"" and I can't help but think they are making fun of each other. First of all, ATSUSHI's voice sounds strangely thin when he sings like this, and TAKAHIRO is not ready for this. I'm also appalled at the fact that he apparently applied for the cover in a hurry after Southern's announcement of their breakup. It's not all about making money. I wish he would take better care of his fans. And I am sure that a lot of ""meek"" fans who came with ""EXILE LOVE"" are leaving the group. I wonder if next year will be just another ""middle-aged group"". Only one good point. The sound quality is a little better than the previous album. I watched it with SONY test-tube type speakers, and I felt so. I would like to continue to be a fan in the hope that EXILE will return to be a group that cares about their fans and gives them love, dreams, and happiness like in the past."
2,"I can't believe that people whose standard is their face comment on EXILE... I guess they think Atsushi's singing voice is just ""He's a good singer, isn't he?"
1,"At first, I had no intention of purchasing this album, but I found it on sale at a second-hand store, so I bought it and listened to it. The songs that have been rewritten are very uncomfortable, and the quality of the songs themselves has dropped considerably. The old songs (around the time of the first chapter) were clearly better, and as someone who knew the songs back then, I couldn't listen to them. Also, ""Galaxy Express 999"" was so bad that I thought it was a blasphemy against the original (Godaigo). It has become a bad work with such a low level of perfection that I think it is a blasphemy against the original (Godaigo). As a result, I sold it after listening to it only once. There are two more bests to come out this year, but this is not good enough.... I will not buy the rest by mistake."
1,"I listened to it anyway. I was thinking of buying it if it was good, but it all sounds like a lie. I thought I would buy it if it was good, but it all sounded like a lie to me."
5,"The best of Kururi is finally on sale. Even though I own almost all of Kururi's CDs, I still want to buy this one. I wonder what the intention is in the arrangement of the songs, with ""Tokyo"" following ""Rock 'n' Roll"". I can't wait to get my hands on this album."
5,"I can't get enough of Seie's storytelling style! This time, it's exactly the kind of song that you can definitely understand if you listen to it. I've noticed that you've been alternating between sad and up-tempo songs on your singles ever since your debut SAKURA. The upcoming ""Hotarunohikari"" is no exception. So what's next? I wonder if Yotchan is deciding on this one? Speaking of Yotchan, his face has changed so much that his cheekbones are noticeable. He will be a good-looking(?) man from now on. I'm looking forward to seeing Seie-chan sandwiched between ""Futari"" (lol)."
5,"Only Superfly would be able to release songs with such different vectors between the main song and the coupling. Superfly is an artist who can deliver two or three tastes in one song. M1 is a magnificent ballad and M2 is a lighthearted R&amp;R. If that were all, it would be common, but the highlight is M3, a cover of a classic, a true ""battle of sounds. The title track M1 is of course great, but I definitely recommend M3, ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo"". It is a super session, different from Rick and Johnny Winter. Tatsukazu's drums pounding, and Hinacchi's bass playing with a swing and a roll. Momo & Kusao's blasting guitars. Shiho was so powerful that she was not only able to stay one step ahead of the blasting sound of the band, but was even able to overpower them. I can't believe that in this day and age, we can listen to such a superb R&amp;R!"
1,"I heard it on the radio, and the melody of the chorus part is exactly the same as the OP song of a certain anime...(sweat). The tempo was indeed different, but I wondered if it was OK. I couldn't listen to the song with any peace of mind."
1,"It all comes down to the title. The rapid advertising and the fact that two single songs, ""Hana ni nare"" and ""Hikari no Hashi,"" have been provided as the equivalent of a single, are all too much of a rush to sell. There are various concerns that have been raised, such as the singing style, lyrics, and tune of their own songs sounding very similar to those of Mistill in a deteriorated state, and that their voices are similar to those of Bump of Chicken (although this is inevitable since they are innate). However, if they can't sell a single song that they wrote themselves, they may not even be able to make it to the starting point as a band. If they can't sell a single song of their own creation, they may not even be able to call themselves a band."
5,"This is Akane Sugasaki's first album! I thought her singing voice was beautiful and nice in the single ""Koi Gokoro""! I think you can't go wrong with buying it!"
5,"When I first heard the song, I thought the lyrics were very suggestive, and the song was full of eroticism. However, I was told that the model was Pink Lady's UFO. I was convinced when I heard that it was a new song (song) that developed the world of songs into J-POP. Sigh-chan's comment, ""I hope the people who listen to it will laugh,"" made me chuckle. I thought that Sigh-chan was in the process of evolving from imitation to creation."
5,"The ultimate album beyond the best. Just as the average music fan knows Michael Jackson's Thriller as common knowledge, this album is common knowledge in the field of HR/HM. It is unlikely that anyone will ever come across an album that contains so many great songs, songs, and performances without a single flaw. I could listen to it hundreds of times and never get tired of it. If you want to be moved by music, listen to this. This is one of the few albums that I am truly glad to have been born in this era and to have encountered."
5,"This is the best of the supreme rocker Rennie. It includes his most popular songs up to ""5,"" the newly written AGAIN, and AMERICAN WOMAN recorded for the Austin Powers Deluxe soundtrack. Lenny won the Grammy Award for BEST MALE ROCK VOCAL PERFORMANCE four years in a row since 1998 for FLY AWAY, AMERICAN WOMAN, AGAIN, and DIG IN (not included on this album)."
4,"Released on February 28, 2006, this is Ne-Yo's debut album. However, he is better known by his real name, Shaffer Chimere Smith, who has already supplied many songs as a songwriter, including ""Let Me Love You,"" which became a big hit for Mario. His stage name was given to him by a friend after Neo, the character played by Keanu Reeves in The Matrix. He chose the spelling Ne-Yo for rights reasons and to signify that it was something new. Born to an African-American bassist father and a Chinese-American pianist mother, Ne-Yo comes from a musical family where all the members are singers. This may be the reason for his outstanding songwriting ability and singing voice.  His songwriting makes excellent use of his beautiful voice. My favorite song is ""So Sick. The lyrics of the song are quite raunchy, but when she starts singing, it fits perfectly. I think it's a bit like Michael Jackson's singing style, which makes me wonder, but as a debut album, I think it's close to a perfect score.  The common disappointment until the third album is that most of the backing music is done by typing, and the skill of the musicians is a little weak. If they could get it just right, I would have no complaints. It is really soothing."
5,"I was hesitant to buy it because Kylie herself had been on a best-of album binge and I had all her albums, but after seeing her Showgirl tour, I was curious about the two new songs and ended up getting them. Disc 1 is a collection of familiar hits of yesteryear and Disc 2 is new &amp; recent singles, so the latter is my favorite."
2,"As seen in the Right-on commercial, #3, SHE'S A GENIUS, is an unquestionably groovy rock tune, though the commercial's impression may have had a synergistic effect. But the rest of the songs don't leave a good impression on me. The momentum of the first album, which included a familiar song from Dinozhi's air-guitar background music, was amplified in the second album to the extent that a sticker with a message of praise from Hiroto Komoto was attached to it, and the edgy slow rock of ""Holiday"" was impressive. However, the band seems to have fallen off the wagon. Lately, I feel like there are not as many old rock bands that are making a name for themselves. Personally, my favorite rock band is THE POLICE, but there is no band with such a special presence like them today. Please please please please please let a band come out that will break all records in the modern rock scene and rock history."
5,"This is a live performance by Chage & Asuka over 25 years ago, shortly after their debut. It's the best of their many records (CDs). Tight drums, aggressive guitar and bass, and another aggressive dobro guitar? I was wondering, but it seems that Ken Yajima is participating as a guest musician. I think it's ""Opinion is Unrequired,"" but thanks to his participation, the song is full of rock flavor and is wonderfully cool. The tension of the band is also very high in the other songs, and Asuka's voice is very long and deep. It is also a pleasure to hear ""Utaite tsutsusuru"" (which can only be heard on the live version), ""Kono koi oira no kara mawara"" (an early folk ballad), and ""Yume kara yume he"" (from a dream to a dream). The sound quality is also better than Live in Yoyogi, with better separation and easier listening. I wonder why the record version is cut so much. Anyway, this complete recording is wonderful. I don't know why I let it sleep until now... I'm glad you released it, and the content is indeed great, but I'm very satisfied with this product compared to DVD-boxes that seem to be just copies from videos to DVDs. I don't think there is anyone out there who is a fan and hasn't bought this, but even for those who aren't, I recommend it with confidence."
1,"The unique, distorted atmosphere of the first version is completely gone, and the cheesy background music throughout the game is a turn-off. Not a single song is superior to the original. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Mr. Iwata has just ironically proven what an excellent composer he is."
2,"I heard that the domestic edition was gorgeous and pre-ordered it, but it was just an imported edition with liner notes added."
5,"Theme song for Fuji TV drama ""Celeb and the Poor Taro"", 12th single of ikimono-gakari. It is a gorgeous and refreshing pop tune, something ikimono-gakari has never had before. Each song has a different tune, and the variety of songs is impressive. The promotional video is also quite nice, so check it out if you haven't seen it yet.  The lyrics of the song ""message"" didn't sound like Ikimono-kari, and I was a little worried before listening to the song, but when I actually listened to it, I really liked the catchy pop that reminded me of early 90's J-POP.  This year, Kimono Gakari has released two albums and five singles. I am very happy to hear more songs from you, but... please don't overdo it."
2,"I don't listen to the songs, so please release a DVD with extreme bare breasts and thongs. I will not buy a DVD with this content."
1,I don't like it. It's more like NEXT STAGE than NEXT LEVEL. I think it's a waste of Ayu's goodness. I feel like it's a waste of time and it's a disappointing album. I hope the next album will be better.
5,"Until recently, I had never heard of Mystyl. I had heard of them because they were always on the charts, but they had never caught my ear before."
5,"This is the first album after he changed his name from ""TAKUI"" to ""Takuhei Nakajima"". I have been listening to his music (and voice) since the first album of his TAKUI days, and I have the impression that many of his songs (and voice) pull strongly and forcefully. His songs (and voice) seemed to pull strongly and powerfully. I guess it fits into the rock and punk genres. Around the time he changed his name to Takuhei Nakajima, he started singing different, gentler songs, and I thought, ""Oh? I honestly wondered whether or not to buy this album, but I am glad I did. But I am glad I did. I got the impression that this album envelops me more gently and warmly than before. I feel the way she sings has changed. I feel that the way he sings has changed. The lyrics still resonate with me as they did in TAKUI's days, and the high-pitched voice is very pleasant to listen to. （The lyrics and the voice are straight to the point. Please take your time to listen to it. Highly recommended."
1,"I listened to a song by this group recommended by an acquaintance. I think the lyrics are just average. I personally thought the singing was too bad. I wonder why this group sells so well, but I thought maybe some of the people who often listen to these groups can relate to the lyrics. Personally, I don't like this group's singing voice because it grates on my ears."
5,"As you can see from the cover, Chara-san's album is overflowing with love, hand in hand with Tadanobu Asano. This warm ""LOVE ALBUM"" conveys the happiness filled with love to everyone who hears it."
5,"Japanese music, Western music, pop, noise, metal, hip-pop... I've listened to a lot of old and new music, but I like this one the best. The sound is really cool. I recommend 10."
5,"Deep Purple had a major impact on the rock world in the 1970s. This album, ""Very Best of Deep Purple,"" is a compilation of songs from their golden era. The songs other than 1215 included in this album are also included in ""Deepest Purple,"" one of Deep Purple's best albums released previously."
2,"Guitarist John Frusciante left the band and Dave Navarro, formerly of Jane's Addiction, joined the band for this album.  The album was not well received by music professionals and was not a sales success, but as you can see from the reviews, there are a surprising number of people who appreciate it. In terms of customer reviews, I personally cannot rate this album too highly, although they are one of my favorite bands.  There is a bit more of a U.S. hard rock sound, perhaps due in part to the addition of Dave, but the band is a bit less good. Also, you can hear that the band tries to express stillness and movement, and to change the atmosphere of the songs. The band's talent is well done, and there is a sense of momentum, but for some reason, it ends without surprising us. I wonder if this can be called a high level of perfection.  Blood Sugar"" was undeniably high in terms of perfection. There were no unnecessary sounds, the song was well composed, and it had a real sense of weight and speed (not in the sense of mechanical distortion or fast tempo). Although they tried to express themselves in a straightforward manner, there was no denying the feeling that they were halfway there musically.  I gave this album two stars because it is neither good nor bad, but it does not show their best side. They are good in that they have established their own style and are open to expressing themselves while understanding the essence of the music. Personally, I am very happy to have John Frusciante back, who has been described as ""one of the three greatest guitarists of our time"" or ""White Jimi Hendrix"". He is certainly true to his expressive nature and has the ability to understand and play with the sounds around him while still valuing harmony. Not that there is anything wrong with Dave at all, but I honestly don't think they would have created this later work if Dave had stayed the same.  If you like Lecchli, you will understand that they rarely play the songs from this album live, and if you don't like ""Medium"", it means you don't like Lecchli.  Although there is a song dedicated to River Phoenix (the actor who appeared in ""Stand By Me""), a close friend of Anthony and Free, who died of a drug overdose, and there is a song dedicated to River on the 13th track, this is an album that they will keep in the back of their minds. One last note for your information. Free's bass playing is amazing not only because of his slaps and quick finger movements. If you are only concerned with such technical things, you will not be able to feel the expressive power and performance ability of the music as a whole. Rather, many bassists, including myself, are capable of just playing. What is really great about him is that he has established his own style and has a sound that only he can produce. He also has a sound that only he can produce, and even though the bass player plays so much, it does not destroy the unity of the song at all. This point is also demonstrated in this album."
2,"With Brendan O'Brien as producer, this second album was made to sound like it was made with the American market in mind. However, it turned out to be a dull and macho hard rock album."
4," It's a great album, isn't it? I think this one is easier to get used to than the original, especially for those who are new to blues. I think it is necessary to think about music in such a way rather than thinking about it too hard."
1,"In terms of vocal luster and depth, guitar tone and phrasing, Clapton is not even close to B. B. King. To put it bluntly, Clapton is just a distraction. It is not a matter of whether Clapton can or cannot play the blues."
1,"One star, but don't get me wrong. Of course I give 5 stars for Queen's music. However, I gave it 1 star because of the CCCD specifications."
5,"Tense music that blows away such things as healing. Technically, it is a masterpiece. This album is often compared to Bradford's work, but am I the only one who thinks it has developed its own unique style? I have not listened to this album in 20 years, and I wonder if it is because of my age that I find this tension soothing. Was I up against something when I was copying in a band when I was around 20 years old?"
4,"If you only know Elle now, please listen to this album! This album doesn't have fast numbers like now, but it has emotional songs that will touch your heart. Especially, 2, 9, and 11 are excellent. It does not have a punk-like groove, which may come as a surprise to those who have recently started listening to Elle, but the more you listen to it, the more you can feel the ""goodness"" in this ""good album""!"
5,This first single in many years is a ballad number by Akihito.
4,"Following the previous two albums, many of the songs on this album seem to be new attempts that cannot be found in Japanese music."
5,"I think there are many people for whom this song became their gateway to Yonbai Yonbai. I am one of them. This song broke away from the image of being a flashy and incomprehensible group, and proved that they have excellent music. Who doesn't want to go on a relaxing trip after listening to the big chorus? It is not old at all even if you listen to it now. I highly recommend this song."
2,Which voice actors? Anime song? I'm a little shocked because I heard the album and thought it was the first female artist with a voice like Onizuka's. It's just too much like that.
1,"The squid-like decoration is 6,000 yen, the memory is 800 yen, and the music is 0 yen. Please AVEX, make it a little cheaper. I feel sorry for Ayu."
5,"What is this feeling that I have never had before? Each song is truly heartwarming! I can feel the great power from the album! Thanks, Miwa and Tadashi, for a really great album!"
1,"Don't really screw around! I have been thinking, ""Aren't you thinking too much about making money?"" But... I finally realized that I've been cheated by all these bests and CDs that are just to create a buzz for the time being. I am so ashamed of myself for claiming to be a fan of Koda Kumi, and I am getting angry at her and her record company. I have hatred for not only Kumi Koda but also Ayumi Hamasaki, Exile, and all other avex artists.... I commented because I don't want any more victims like me who have been deceived for a long time."
2,"SHM-CDs, which are becoming more and more common these days, are not too expensive, but a regular disc should suffice. I don't see many CDs with ""gold"" deposited instead of aluminum, which was popular for a while. Aren't they just being bought because they are said to have ""good sound""?　If you have a preconceived notion, it will sound better than the regular CDs. Just like a fake medicine works on your body if you believe in it.　As for the content, I can give it 5 stars except for the first track. The first song is a use (appropriation) of the singing voice of Minako Honda, who died in 2005, and I don't appreciate it. The method is not fair. It was made into a duet without her consent (which of course cannot be obtained nowadays), so I give it zero stars. As a fan of Minako Honda, I would like to tell her never to make something like this. I want to cry if such pseudo-duet and pseudo-performances like this come out in the future. It must be a matter of the ""ethics"" of the producers if it goes this far. But is it enough if the music is beautiful?　I hope the music industry will never produce such ""pseudo"" works again."
1,"Still, let me say this. It is not a message song that strikes at the heart of the matter like last year's hit ""Wamo ko"". And most of all, I don't know who the person in the picture is (laughs)!"
5,"This is the best album of Miki Imai's early years. The original release was in 1989, so it was already 16 years ago. Listening to this album now, I am reminded of various historical backgrounds, but once again I am impressed by the careful creation of the sound. The poems are rich in their insistence and conveyance of the main theme, and the arrangement of the songs reflects the theme and subject matter of the songs. I think all of them are passable. My personal favorite is the inclusion of the album mix of ""Winds of the Wild. It is definitely a re-mix of the master tape of the single song, but I was interested in how the interpretation and mix balance could change the song so much, which is why I liked it and thought it was a good point. Listening to it now, it certainly has a dated feel, but I think you can still feel that Yusaku's music is worth listening to."
5,"Although the title track is famous, the last song on the album, ""Last Resort,"" is the most famous song that symbolizes this album. The indescribable feeling of silence or emptiness that remains after listening to the song is similar to the B-side of the Beatles' ""Abbey Road. For some reason, the photo on the album cover reminds me of the last scene in the movie ""The Shining."
1,"I don't like the advertisement of ""a great ballad that surpasses TADA...AIN'T WANT TO SEE YOU"". TADA...AITAIKETSU"" is a superb ballad with lyrics written by SHUN, and I am very attached to this song. The Birthday ~Ti Amo~ is a song that the composer of ""Lovers again"", which commemorated the 8th anniversary, worked very hard on. I wish you would stop comparing songs in your advertisements. It's a shame that they arranged and packed old songs as couplings. I feel that each song is not cherished. I am also shocked that EXILE's debut song ""Your eyes only -A vague outline of me-"" was simply re-sung. （Anyway, singers are only as good as their songs, so I hope EXILE will take good care of their songs."
2,"I thought ""I Believe"" had childish lyrics when I heard it as a single, but when juxtaposed with the other songs like this, the childishness is even more noticeable. Besides, there were six songs written by ATSUSHI, including the single, but even though the tunes were different, the lyrics were all similar in phrasing. The difficult word ""fate"" seems a bit strange in a song like ""Summer Time Love"" with its cheerful tone. As for the other songs, ""What Is Love"" is just mumbling and doesn't leave any impression, and ""Jazz Falling from the Sky"" was good when I listened to it, and the lyrics were the best on the album, but after listening to it, the melody didn't stick in my head at all. Then there is ""Make Love,"" which seems to be an attempt to express ""love"" in a cool type of song, but when this type of song is performed by someone who has become a nice person character in Okazairu, it gives the impression of being ""cool"" rather than ""cool"". And ""Lover's Again,"" if it is an orchestra version, the background music is too self-assertive and the lyrics cannot be appreciated. I prefer the first version of this song. I plan to borrow the DVD from a friend in the near future, but I think I'll just check out the last two songs and the DVD."
1,"If they are going to do this, why don't they just give away a box to all applicants who buy the three best albums? If you already have all three albums, don't buy it. That's exactly what Avex wants you to do."
5,"I'm not that much of a Spitz fanatic myself, but compared to the Cherry days, I think they have improved tremendously. I felt that way after listening to this album. It is not often that I am captivated by all the songs on an original album, but this time I fell in love with all of them☆Even 5296 by Kobukuro, who are currently at the peak of their popularity, there are some songs that I do not like (I am not putting them down by any means. Of course, there are songs I liked), but I take my hat off to Spitz for their cunning! I don't have any particular songs to recommend, just listen to them all. They are all refreshing, uplifting, and energizing. I can only say that they are the veterans of 18 years since their debut!"

2,"It's like a band that can be found anywhere. The melody is also normal. Well, it's their first album. I guess that's about it."
5,"I can't say for sure since I haven't heard their earlier albums, but to my ears that have heard classic metal, it sounded very comfortable, especially the guitar solos. Disturbed may have been lumped together with other so-called NU-METAL bands, but what you hear here sounds like a normal HEAVYMETAL band that has established an authentic but unique style. SYSTEM OF A DOWN"" sounded much more mixed. 　Also, the style in which the unique VOCAL sounded like a single musical instrument (a style of singing like a machine gun, melodically and rap-like), I was honestly ""hit"" by it."
2,"You are still young, so how did you end up with so many conservative songs? Did they have to save up singles and make them look like a bargain because they didn't have any more hits than Crescent Moon? Young singers could have maintained a sense of freshness if they had released albums in short intervals. Now I feel that they are just mid-level idols who seem to have gained dignity for nothing. I think it is hard to keep increasing the sense of value once you sell in this way, but I hope for the future."
2,"I will admit that it is a great quality arrangement of some of the songs on the soundtrack. I really like [BALTO] and [LAHAN]. But what are those cheap lyrics that seem to have been translated into Japanese by a Japanese translation tool? I try to listen to the ED songs on the soundtrack because I can listen to them in English without understanding the meaning. Still, there are too many songs with lyrics. It's a good arrangement, but this one point alone is enough to irritate me. How about that ""put my favorite song in my library and go straight to the storeroom"" kind of arrangement version?"
5,"Tomokazu Tashiro, composer of Moetan op and Haruhi ed, and Aki Hata, lyricist, are in charge of the coupling songs. This tag team is still amazing. It is very addictive. The vocalist, mako-san, was also great. I only know Kamichu, so I didn't think she could do such a wide range. There are some lines, but I guess that's just my taste. I feel it's elaborate, but I don't think I needed it. Anyway, this is one piece where I could feel perfectly that Mr. Tashiro has not declined. It was good!"
5,"It's a remake of ""Hello, Sadness,"" ""Into the Dream,"" ""White Flame,"" and ""Family Dining Table.""  The songs were never chosen in order of popularity, so I wonder if she chose the songs she wants to sing now.  I love it. Yuki is still wonderful even as an auntie.  White Flame"" is one of those songs that I just can't help but think of as not very grandmotherly, but I'm surprised that it's even better than it was when it was first released."
1,"I don't know why it was not released on CD for 30 years after its broadcast. And when it was finally released on CD, the sound quality was so poor that it was a disservice to the fans who had been waiting for it. Many of Baldios' songs are short and end just as they are about to get exciting. The same is true of the film version. The music is so large that it is hard to enjoy it when it is played in small increments. But even so, I think it is Kentaro Haneda's extraordinary talent that even now we never get tired of listening to these masterpieces. In particular, ""Afrodia ni Hanabutsuwa wo"" (Bouquet to Afrodia) is wonderful. The latter half of the song, which was played in the scene where David watches from behind the door as Quinstein waits for him in his room during Operation Ice Age, and then departs for a suicide mission, remains with me to this day. It's a good thing I got to hear this song, but the sound quality is the worst I've ever heard. It would be better to find a record on Yahoo!"
5,"I must buy this CD. After all, the movie on this CD (Latias and Latios, the protectors of the city of water) was the first movie that made me cry! I watch the DVD and listen to the CD every day to memorize the lyrics! By the way, my teacher said, ""Oh, this guy is one of THE BOOM who became a million-seller 10 years ago."" He is one of THE BOOM who became a million-seller 10 years ago. And that's it! You will definitely get a lot out of buying this CD! I scored 3 out of 100 on a music test, and I have the ultimate tone deafness and no emotion syndrome, but I was moved by this song, so there is no doubt about it!"
1,"I have been searching for years for the OP&amp;ED of Queen 1000 years. I finally found it and bought it without hesitation, but I was surprised when I listened to it. It is not the original. Couldn't you find the original sound source? It's a very sad cover version. I bought this CD for these two songs. I have no use for this CD, so I'm giving it up immediately."
1,"As a song, it is usually one star. If you listen to it calmly, you will understand. You missed it spectacularly. You shouldn't have done that at a time like this.... No matter how great the promotion is or how good the PV is, it doesn't matter if the original song is not good. The singing ability of the group is not that great to begin with, so if they don't pull it off with the quality of the songs, they will look even worse. I hope they will make up for it in their next album."
1,"I have been playing the Tales series since Destiny. (I haven't played it recently, but I bought it because the theme song of Hearts was sung by DEEN. So I watched it with high expectations, but...? What is this? In the past series, I could imagine the world or the pictures when I heard the song even if I had not played the game, but this time, I can't picture anything at all. I think there are a lot of people who like the theme song and think they might want to try the game (I was one of them), so I think you should make the song more Tales-like. I really just listened to it, so I don't even know if it's the theme song for the new Tales, but that's my honest opinion."
5,"When I am a little tired, I feel much more at ease when I surrender my body and mind to this CD, and I am inspired to work hard again after I refresh myself with this music. I am saved by her calm and beautiful voice and the melodies that easily enter my heart."
2,"Did they want to be U2? The song is a bit like a sponge cake that has been overblown and overstuffed, but it's still a good song. I felt a sense of loss similar to the after-effects of a sponge cake that has been ""too much"" well inflated. I was so impressed by the laconic comments of ☆☆☆☆☆5 stars written before the release date that I was tempted to ask, ""Are you related to them? I would have given it one star. Normally, I would have given it one star, but since I paid for it myself, I'll give it two stars. It was the first time in a long time that I had been duped by an advance promotion."
5,"Finally, a complete collection of Yoshie's hit songs is now available.  This is the definitive CD containing her debut single ""No.1"" and the 18 songs that made the Oricon Top Ten singles chart!  In particular, the single version of ""Ano Koko Kara"" has never been included in a best-selling album before, and the two songs that have been hard to find, ""Mischievous Night Doll"" and ""Taiyo wa Shiranai Shiru Shiru"", have not been available on CD since 1985."
1,"I have always wondered why Yasu-san is so unappreciated. I often wonder why Yasu-san is so unappreciated. ・・・・・・・ I often think that there are many cases in which artists with great talent, taste, and intelligence are not easily recognized by the world. This is exactly the case with Yasu-san. I feel that Yasu's guitar playing, songwriting, arranging ability, etc. are all first-class talents. I think fans should see more of that and feel something. I was astonished when I saw the popularity poll on the Off Course website before the album was released. Even before the poll started, I knew it would be skewed toward Oda's music, but I didn't expect it to be so skewed. I didn't realize that all of Oda's songs were ranked from No. 1 to No. 20. ・・・・・・ Well, one of the factors is that there are too many meek fans, but as I mentioned earlier, the lack of appreciation for Yasu-san is also a possible factor. Therefore, considering the allocation of two songs by Matsuo-san as well, although not limited to Yasu-san, I do not think they would understand the appeal of just two songs by Yasu-san and Matsuo-san, respectively, and would not show interest in them. Off Course is an extremely rare and wonderful band with multiple main vocalists. In this respect, they are familiar with the Beatles and the Eagles. Each member has a rich individuality. It seems to me that there are too many fans out there who are listening to them in a way that is a waste of time. If this is the case, why doesn't Toshiba EMI make an effort to convey to future generations that Off-Course is a band with a rich individuality, even if only in a small way? This album makes me think about that again."
5,"If Yumi is an indispensable writer when looking back on the early Hi-Fi set, Mari Sugi was the one who continued to support the success of the girls in their later numbers. In particular, the girls' early albums consciously tried to put an urban sensibility at the forefront, and Yumi, who was on the rise at the time, was perfectly suited to this line of thinking. As for Mari Sugi, she has included his works in all of her albums since her 1984 album ""Pasadena Park,"" and in total he has provided the girls with a considerable number of works. This album is a collection of works by these two, and it is surprising to find a truly wonderful collection of songs. Of the 22 songs on this album, 22 are by Yumi and 15 by Sugi. It goes without saying that Yumi's songs are good, but looking back at the later Hi-Fi set, Sugi's works are very lively and really bring out the girls' personalities after ""Feeling"" hit. In this respect, in a sense, he may have accomplished more than Yumi. Speaking of their best-known work, ""Feeling"" is still one of my favorites. This song is certainly good, too. However, I much prefer the lively and shining songs on this album, and I think they suit the girls better. Am I exaggerating?"
1,"This is a good example of how you can lose money if you rely on other people's evaluations. It is inexpensive, but I felt I wasted my money. Enya is much more heartfelt. Whether you like it or not, the qualities of the musician are greatly reflected in the work. I was not at all soothed by listening to this."
2,"I can't say it's the best album considering the works of artist Ayumi Hamasaki that have been released so far. There are many works that only sold well, but the quality is not high. There are also many mistakes in song selection. It is nonsense to think that individual works sold well = best with high quality. There are also some bad albums that were sold only because of tie-up effects such as TV dramas and CFs."
1,"Well, sadly, I have to agree with your scathing review of this poor best-of album release. The song selection, the song order, the cover, and most importantly, why not release it as a 2-disc set at a more reasonable price? I can't help but wonder about these points. It's a best album that makes me sigh and lose my desire to buy it."
4,"As others have said, the first song, So What, is by far the catchiest and uppiest number, so I think the rest of the songs sound subdued. The fact that the second song is followed by several mid-tempo songs also makes it hard to get a lasting impression. I think this is an album that requires a lot of listening. However, I also thought that as you listen to the album, you can feel the goodness of all the songs, so I gave it 4 stars. It is, after all, a good collection of songs. By the way, the first song is No. 1 in the U.S., but the album is hardly talked about in Japan... I think they should advertise it a little more, lol."
2,"Overall, the sparkling sound quality, and the clear, bright Stones sound did not sit well with me personally. The acoustic guitar sound was also unpleasant and unfamiliar. I think the Stones' sound would be tighter if the drums and bass were mixed with the same degree of on-ness, as is the case in live performances. I think the sound of each instrument is disjointed and not well-balanced. I don't like the performance, especially the keyboard playing. The rare songs are exciting, but I wonder if this is the best performance of the Stones live. I don't think I want to hear it again and again."
5,"It is more elegant than Tomifeb, and like Takashi Fujii's example song, it succeeds in floating 80's flavors in a good way."
2,"I think most of the people who purchased this CD are those who learned about May'n through Macross F. Of course, I am one of them. I think most of the buyers are people who like anime songs, but I think all of the songs on the CD, with the exception of Lion, fall into the category of pops. I don't mean to denigrate the pop genre, and I like a lot of pop songs myself. But unfortunately, the songs on Main Street are just pop songs. May'n has enough singing ability and personality, so I don't think I was able to find a good song this time. I hope she will be able to encounter more great songs next time."
1,"The selection of the person in charge of lyrics, composition, and arrangement is completely wrong. If you want to hear this kind of music, just buy Morning Musume。 I don't understand why they let Ms. Hirano sing this song. I don't understand why they let Ms. Hirano sing. I think it is safe to say that buying this CD is the same as accepting the shoddy work of the people around Ms. Hirano."
5,"It's been a while since I bought a single. Tomoaki Ishikawa sang the ending song of Gundam Seed as See-Saw. I had the impression that the two songs of Gundam Seed were also outstanding and fully integrated into the world view. I apologize for my lack of study. I've been waiting for this album to be released on December 3, 2008. And the PV is also very nice. As for the ED of the second season of Gundam 00, I really hope that Mr. Ishikawa will be in charge of the new ED after the second season. In an interview with director Mizushima of 00, he commented that both the OP and ED expressed the world view of 00, and that he felt a strong sense of control. It could be Marina's feelings, or it could sound like the song of Mari and Aleruya. Gundam 00 is also becoming the most critically acclaimed series, and I was able to get to know Tomoaki Ishikawa. According to her, ""This title 'Prototype. It means 'disposable.'"" That's right. It's a harsh title. And I think. Her attitude toward lyrics over the course of her career. The first line of the lyrics reaches me like the echo that echoes in the ED of the second season of Gundam 00. Thank you, Brain Quantum School MAX, for releasing such a good song at the end of the year. This is my pleasure. I will buy the album, too."
4,"The song itself is fine, but I think it's quite mismatched with the content of the anime.... I think the first episode and such are fine, but I'd like to see the OP changed around the end."
5,"This is good! As a fan of Brian's music, I am delighted by the quality of each song and the power of his voice, which shows how well he is doing now. Brian's songs have a magic that makes listeners feel happy, and this is the first time in a long time that I can fully feel it. "
2,"Yeah, it's great. It's very her. She was married and divorced when she was in America. The days when she was so hurt and scared of love that she couldn't even trust herself to love. Through those days, she met a loved one whom she could truly trust. And that she is now able to move forward with hope, knowing that her love is real. In this song, she sings about her personal life. But you know what? I can't help but feel that this whole sequence of events is intended to be a story that will move people and make them sympathize with the song. It was the same with the previous song ""Sakura-iro,"" but the double-edged sword of showing a story is a negative in this song. If you do this kind of thing continuously, it feels too dull and boring. The arrangement also feels mediocre because it is a ""standard"" arrangement. It's a little disappointing..."
5,"Speaking of Macross, the song! I can't stop listening to it again. I think the quality of the images and the way the images and music are combined are very well done. My companion, who loves mechas, and I, who love music, both enjoy watching this movie, and if this is your first experience with Macross, I highly recommend you to watch the past Macross movies as well. And of course, this one too!"
2,"I got my hands on this album when I saw it on the Oricon charts. 　Before listening to it, I was listening to a Do As Infinity album in the car. Not necessarily because of that, but in comparison, this album sounded very cheap and tinny to me. In my opinion, the music is 10 years behind Do As. I didn't think her use of synths or sense of melody was bad at all, but I guess it means that she is not out of the realm of imitating someone else. 　I don't know her well, but I guess she is a person who often sings anime songs. Are her songs appropriate as theme songs for anime? If you listen to them with this in mind, I think they have reached a very wonderful level."
1,"This is terrible. I thought their last album ""By Your Side"" was a masterpiece. I also enjoyed the live performance with Jimmy Page. I had not been able to buy this album until now due to circumstances, so I was very much looking forward to buying it this time. And yet, what is this? What is this? I was sick after the first song. I was sick after the first song. They were just making totally inappropriate and disproportionate sounds. You've got to be kidding me! Just because you got a little money and the brothers are on bad terms with each other, don't create a work that makes a mockery of the many listeners who have been Fan for a long time. This is a blasphemy against Fan! I bought the double-disc live album released in 2006 at the same time, but I'm too scared to listen to it. I'll listen to it because I have no choice. First one star in my long life of reviewing...or zero, I don't care."
2,"To be frank, it's average or below average. I liked it after listening to ""Honto no Ne"", but the lyrics of ""Honto no Ne"" were written by Hatsune herself, but the music was composed by someone else. I'm not sure if it's Hatsune or Hatsune Okumura, but I'm glad I didn't buy the album with the DVD. It's a good album to listen to when you want to relax. If there is a next album, please put more punchy songs in it!"

2,"When you have the best CD, you can't help but say to others, ""I'm buying it!　Buy it!"" I say, ""Buy it!"" to others. 。。。。。 　But this CD is like ""?　I'm like, ""What? 　I don't feel like it's the best of the best, or that it's enjoyable! I made this CD as a last-minute effort. 　It feels like it was made as a last-minute effort. 　The present video is also not really like that ・・・・. 　And the new version of ""Merry Christmas Someday"" was like, ""What's with this tambourine, it's like an arts-and-crafts show! The sound is very annoying. 　I guess it's because it's December and Christmas, but don't you think you're taking your fans for fools?"
2,"As for the quality of the work, I felt that this is what you can expect from Being these days. Neither Kuraki nor the singer has a punch in their poetry or singing voice, nor do they have an outstanding personality, so in the end, it depends too much on the songwriters. The overproduction is a bit on the nose. It's not bad, but it's not good, either. The music is a perfect reflection of the company's ineffectual, neither poison nor medicine, safe and boring, and always lacking in one more thing. But what I would like to say here is that the visual work is wonderful! This company is known for its lame and shoddy visual work. If you don't know what they are, please use the search form above and look up ""garnet crow"" or ""Mai Kuraki"". Not only tacky, but also old. Naka was different from the rest. She is known for her fashion sense, and her clothes and makeup are also superb. And this is the highest quality ever. The jacket is erotic and cool! The booklet has a different approach for each song, fashion magazine style, 80s style, movie star style, etc. It's a cool art book. However, the songs themselves are similar or lacking in substance, so it is questionable whether this concept is even being utilized. I also wonder if she is the best choice for the subject of the book. I thought that she might go the sexy route in the future, but she didn't seem to be the best choice for the next single.... What? I thought it would be good for her to go the sexy route in the future, but the singles after that. The jacket is also '? The cover is also a bit too 'orange night'. I don't think Orange Night is going to happen. Compared to Ayumi Hamasaki, who challenged semi-nudity for her second album, I think her bad luck is going to be her undoing. I hope she doesn't disappear as a typical female singer who can't stay as a pop singer because of her age."
1,"To be honest, I was disappointed. I had pre-ordered the single a few months ago and had high hopes for it, but whether it was the music or her voice, I felt as if I was listening to a B-side song. Maybe it's the music, but I'm sure she can sing better! I believe so and will try to support her a little longer."
1,"As the title says, only ""Kiseki"" is an okay song (but I still get bored after a few listens), but the other songs are kind of light. They don't touch my heart, and I don't even want to listen to them again. I would have appreciated it a little more if the singing ability alone was better, but at this level.... I thought it was fine to give it 1 star. I thought it was good, so I gave it 1 star. There is plenty of better music out there, so music fans would be safer to look elsewhere."
4,"The star of the show is Michael's vocal. The ""fatness"" of his child voice from the Jackson Five days is completely gone, and his voice has changed to a delicate, thin, ""refined"" voice. This weak voice is emanating an appealing charm that draws people in. 　In terms of technique, the timing of voicing and cutting is exquisite. Her rhythmic interpretation is genius."
5,"After Michael Jackson's death, I cannot stop feeling a little bit of regret in writing his review. However, in order to pray for Michael's soul, I would like to write about a personal Michael's work. BAD. I bought this album several decades ago when I was a freshman in high school. At the time, when I was a freshman in high school, we were transitioning from the age of vinyl records to the medium of CDs. Before that, I had rented records from rental stores.

However, it was the so-called minor songs on the album that first introduced me to Michael's greatness. A great artist has a quality of excellence that is greater than that of a single song on an album, not a single song. I fell in love with the album ""BAD"" when I was a freshman in high school. I didn't understand the lyrics. But I was fascinated by his beautiful voice. The single ""BAD"" was a very pop song with a good tempo, but the songs hidden in the album were so melancholy that I listened to them over and over again with my Walkman headphones on high volume. I was into heavy metal music at the time, but Michael's unique personality shone through. I felt no compromise in this album. I could even feel Michael's spirit. It was a night in my first year of high school. He was a night owl and had been arrested by the police many times. I listened to this album many times when I was conflicted about the meaning of my birth. That is why it is so dear to my heart.

I listened to this album many times when I was conflicted about the meaning of my birth. That is why it is so dear to my heart. As I write this, I feel a little sadness. Michael is gone. However, he is still alive in my mind through his albums. I am sure that those who were enchanted by Michael's songs will also have their own Michael in their hearts. ......"
1,"I've only listened to it once since I bought it. I still think you should sing the first chapter in a chapter. It inevitably causes me to compare it to SHUN. I had EXILELOVE and EVOLUTION and I liked them, but I don't understand the meaning of EXILE now. The fans of the second chapter say to the fans of the first chapter, ""Don't hang on to the first chapter anymore,"" but it's the current EXILE that hangs on to the songs written by SHUN. They don't even re-record ""I just want to see you"", right? It should have been a special song, right? I was sad because I loved EXILE so much. I don't want you to disappear, so please reconsider the way you're doing things now. New songs are good, so let's compete with new songs! How many of the fans who shared the excitement with EXILE at the live in 2005 are still EXILE fans? I want to know how Atsushi feels."
1,"Somehow the debut song was the best.... But before it became a long seller, two very ordinary singles in a row.... A complete stall. He's all about impact, but he's too ordinary and boring."
1,"I borrowed it from a friend because it had many tie-ups with dramas and games, and I was a little curious about it after listening to it every day on the cable at my part-time job. Well...now that I've sat down and listened to it carefully, I have to admit that my impression of it was subtle. Perhaps it was my own taste, though. First of all, the lyrics are not snappy, or rather, they are cheesy... ""It will catch your ear, but it won't stay in your heart,"" especially in the chorus. Especially the chorus. The vocals are half-hearted, as if ELT and ZARD were added and divided by two, and I don't feel any originality (good or bad aside). (You can understand this when you compare it with EURO or TRANCE omnibus or artist albums.) Are they still in the process of exploring their musicality? However, now that you have become so famous, I hope that you will take your time to develop something of a certain quality and release it to the world. I guess you could say that they are ""riding the wave"" right now. I think they are ""riding the wave"" right now, but in a bad way, they are ""getting too carried away""^^; For these reasons, I could not accept them. I am sorry. It seems that they are going to participate in Kohaku, and I hope that they will establish their own musical style by then. Or rather, I feel that if they don't do so, the existence of the unit itself will be in danger. At the very least, I will never pick up a CD from this unit again, nor will I recommend it to others. I am sure you must be feeling a lot of pain in your stomach being caught between the company and the listeners, but I wish you the best of luck in the future."
1,"Silly lyrics, fake smiles, dancing that is embarrassing to watch, super tone deafness, unimpressive people on the side, noisy electronic sounds.... Well, this is just the beginning.  But what pisses me off the most is Avex's push! Well, of course. She was in the Oricon list even though she is not a big seller, she appeared in the Kohaku Uta Gassen within 3 months of her debut (I changed the channel at that time), and to top it all off, she debuted as an actress (with radish, of course). I wish they would stop screwing around! It's disrespectful to the artists who are working hard! You don't even sell well."
1,"The album was on sale at TSUTAYA, so I listened to it. I thought ""Winter Game"" was a little better than the other songs, but the rest were of low quality. （I thought ""Winter Game"" was only a little better, but the rest were of low quality (even the singles were hardly impressive...) The fact that all the songs had tie-ups and appeared in Kohaku was probably due to pressure from avex! I heard something more unbelievable... Chisa, the vocalist, is going to make her debut as an actress? Perhaps avex has been working behind the scenes to make Chisa, who is not so well known, famous in the entertainment industry. This is the kind of thing that causes the general public to react against avex!"
1,"Despite the record company's desperate marketing efforts, the content of the album is not good at all. The ""big newcomer"" hype is unnatural, and the mention of tie-ins to all the songs only shows the buzz. It is rare that the media and listeners are so different in temperature. The songs I've heard so far have all been very similar, with little substance. They call it an album, but I don't think we can expect much from it. That's why I gave it 1 star."
4,"GRAPEVINE has never really bottomed out. Originally, they showed us various faces with each album release. Lyricism, impulse, sensuality, and even purity have dived deep into their sound and words. However, this album swallows all of them with its whole body. I feel that it is even a premonition to re-construct and spit out each of the sounds within without erasing them. As the title suggests, various sounds sound and scatter, but before you know it, they reach you. I am sure that even they themselves cannot see the bottom. It may sound strange, but I expect their next work to be a masterpiece as soon as possible. The prologue, which will be something extraordinary, will never betray us."
2,"I love BONNIE very, very much, but for once, I am really disappointed. It doesn't shake my heart as usual. I think the melody line and lyrics are boring. I am really, really disappointed. I hope for the next album."
5,"The intense and sad lyrics, which seem to speak for the contents of the drama that serves as the theme song, make you sympathize with the song. Hikaru Utada's husky voice is so appealing that you can almost feel her breathing. The lyrics, ""In sickness and in health, in stormy days and in sunny days, let's walk together...""... It is a sensitive and beautiful song that makes you want to share everything in your life, like an accomplice in a captive love, even though it is scary."
1,"I play songs that I don't normally talk about. In other words, I play out of pretension. In other words, he is playing for the judges of the competition, but ignoring the angels. There is no sense of ease or pleasure in this guitarist's playing. If you want to listen to this CD, I recommend renting it rather than buying it. I also recommend the Segovia and Yepez CDs, although the sound sources are older."
4,"I heard Miki Ando using it in her free skate at the All-Japan Championships, so I picked this one out of many recordings and bought it. Because it was beautiful. I think the sound of the solo violin is really accurate and pure. However, I couldn't feel the gravity that I expected from this concerto. I think it is because this beautiful violinist is still young and does not understand the popular aspect of this famous piece. Popularity is not a bad thing. Emotions are first moved from there and then sublimate into art. I think this song seeks the possibility of such magic."
1,"I have collected all B'z albums since the early days and B'z was my favorite music. For me, this album was a great disappointment. (The same goes for everything after this album)."
2,"I have recently upgraded my stereo system and have started listening to a lot of female vocal music. I also purchased this album after reading your evaluation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with Haley's voice. I feel that due to her young age, there is no range in her singing style and voice. It is inferior to other women singing classical music. I know this is a harsh evaluation, but it is just my personal assessment."
5,"Timeless→BUGRIGHT→PROGLUTION Sales of Timeless were less than 80,000, and BUGRIGHT was over 110,000. Including endescape, the theme song for the anime ""Chikyu e..."", Shaka Beach, which was the second highest non-tie-in single, and Ukiyo Crossing, the theme song for the drama ""Working Man"", and Roots, which was only sung at summer concerts and au events. The DVD will include the PVs of the above songs, the PV of Zero no Answerer, which was included in the previous album BUGRIGHT, as well as special features (behind-the-scenes footage of the PV shoot) and a hidden video (Otonoha PV). The songs from the singles on the album (end, shaka, ukiyo) will be re-recorded in album version, except for ukiyo CROSSING."
2,"It is a parade of nostalgic melodies that would have been made by the same people who sent out Yutaka Ozaki and slapped her ass. I felt sorry for the listeners of today who only have a chance to listen to this kind of music. The arrangement is on the level of pickling, and the lyrics are 20th century. I can't believe that YUI herself wrote this song. If she really wrote the lyrics, she is an old woman in her 40s. It is such a rare work that reeks of corruption."
1,"The vocalist looks like a combination of Minowa from Harisenbon and Yamane from Angirls, and the other members are ugly to say the least... Their performance and singing ability are below the middle level, the lyrics are on the level of junior high school students (they were written for a movie, but they don't match the movie), and they look like BUMP OF CHICKEN. But the fact that he can be considered good-looking and reach the top of the charts even if he's ugly (although he drops off the charts in the second week), thanks to the push by his agency and record company, has definitely given courage to the ugly guys in the world."
1,I want you to sell it in one piece. I think you are a narcissist and don't need three patterns.
2,"I feel like splitting the album into two really makes it halfway through. Perhaps because the only smash hit since the last album is Haneuma Rider, I can't deny the lack of volume. Although I personally like many of the songs... it's a bit of a disappointment."
1,"I didn't like it much before, but after hearing this, I feel even more disappointed. Her voice is not right. I don't think she is a singer for this kind of rock tunes because of her weak voice."
1,"Although it is called ""Single Collection,"" there are only six singles in the album, and the rest of the songs seem to be couplings, etc. There are no new songs either. The rest of the album seems to consist of couplings, etc., and there are no new songs. The jacket is also unintelligible. For the fans who have all the singles"
1,"To be honest, those who have high expectations will be greatly disappointed. The song is arranged and edited in the image of the younger sister of Harehare Yukai, but you should not expect too much just because I wrote this. If this is part of your repertoire, it's not too late to buy it after watching it if it's available for rental."
2,The single cut sing is a real classic. The promo video is also quite good and funny. They throw cakes at each other and it's hilarious. The guitar sound is simple and nice.
4,"As you can see from the guest list of SIGUR ROS and others, this is an electronica sound that is in season. The music itself is very good, and the sound is pleasant to listen to. The music itself is very good, and the sound is pleasant to listen to. The entire album is mainly instrumental, but there are also some songs, so it is very easy to listen to for those who do not like heavy electronica. Of course, this album is recommended for those who like Stereo Love, Jim O'Rourke, etc., and also for those who like the cool and refreshing sound of Kings of Convenience, Phoenix, etc."
2,"Compared to the usual albums under the name Rei Harakami, the length of each song is shorter. I have the impression that the song ends just as you are about to be pulled in softly. I guess it can't be helped since the songs were written for a movie, but if you are expecting that kind of drifting sensation, you may be disappointed. However, even though the song is short, you can still feel a sense of floating, and I think that's great. If you play the music at random while layering these tracks, you can drift along just fine."
5,"I had never known a band that could convey so much emotion and impulse through instrumentation. I had no idea that a world expressed through sound alone could be so comfortable. I was simply engulfed and overwhelmed by the waves of sound. The sound is rougher than the recently released second album, but it has more energy. This is a band that I would rather listen to live than on CD, but give it a try."
5,"This song (ORIGINAL COLOR) is played at the end of the movie, and I think it's a pretty good song. It's so good that I find myself humming along to it! If you haven't heard it yet, I'm sure it's worth a listen through the drama. I can't wait to get the CD!"
2,"After playing ""Portishead"" and ""Chiquita Boots"" by Judas, Mr. Asai himself said on the radio. He said on the radio, ""I felt that the sound was not so good (compared to the foreign recordings). I think we need to do some overseas recording. Unlike Blankey and the Chiavettes, whose works have changed dramatically from album to album, Judah's works all have a similar sound. Even when they are put together like this as a best-of album, you can listen to all of them without feeling too much discomfort. However, I do not think that the sound is good. Roughly speaking, it sounds too much like ordinary pop music. The ""space"" between sounds is not filled in well, and there is no sense of ""wabi sabi"". The Blankey era had the best engineer in Japan, Mr. Nanseki, so listeners who have been listening to the album since that time may feel it is lacking in quality. On the other hand, people who usually listen to J-pop might like the sound. Personally, I don't find any masterpieces from the Judas era that can be called gems like Blankie and the Chiavettes did. The song ""Cosmic Lost"" is quite good, but I am dissatisfied that only the live performance is included in this best-of album. If you don't like the ""sound"" of this disc, it would be better to start with Blanky's and Chiavetz's works without going any deeper into Judah's works. As an addendum, the video clips on the DVD are clichéd compared to the high standard of other music videos in recent years. Some of them were good, though."
2,"First of all, although there are two patterns, the number of songs included in the album is 4 ...... maxi-singles? If I were to evaluate it without prejudice, I'd say it's at the level of a ""lower or slightly inferior"" band that would disappear from the scene if it were a normal gal-band."
5,"The karaoke scenery that was played as the ED of the anime Lucky Star until episode 12 is now available as a CD. Tracks 1 through 12 are as broadcasted, and tracks 13 through 25 contain the full chorus versions of the songs that were only played halfway through the broadcast. Full chorus, of course, does not mean that all the songs are free! Tsukasa is a little bit pissed off by Konata's outburst! Kagami makes Konata reflect on her actions! Miyuki sings with great passion! Anyway, please listen to it, it's amazing. From the feel of the final track, it seems that the karaoke is still going on, and it's time for the original ED in the main version, please."
1,"When I saw the music video on TV, for a moment I thought I had an ear infection or brain disease. It may be an exaggeration to say that I had no idea what they were saying. As others have commented, it was truly ""indecipherable. I can't help but cry when I think of the hard work of the recording engineers."
1,"I don't know what's so good about it. Lame melody, lame lyrics, and too bad a singer (lol)."
5,"I have been listening to it on LP ever since its release, but I was interested in the remastered sound quality, so I bought it. My impression is that it has been very carefully remastered, and the string sounds in particular are very sparkling. The difference is noticeable even when compared to the previously released best of ultimate album. The ""Glass no Kobin,"" which used to be a lively, clattering song, became quieter, and the echo of ""Himawari,"" which used to be blurred, became clearer, allowing the listener to appreciate the vocals more closely. If the previous sound was ""bright and energetic,"" this time it is ""calm and serene. Is it an exaggeration to say that the sound is ""like a wine that has ripened"" after more than 20 years since the original? Regrettably, this is her first album, and her vocal expression is not as expressive as her later works. However, even if we deduct that, the content is good enough to give 5 stars. I hope she will re-record it next year, the 25th anniversary of her debut, with the same contents."
5,"It is not a simple emo sound, but features some pop beat sounds in places. Personally, I thought the sound might be a little thin. But if you make it too thick, the pop sound will be lost... At any rate, if you like emo, you won't regret buying this album."
2,"I had been waiting for this album for a long time, and I welcomed it with high expectations... It's not bad... it's not bad, but... I feel like it lacks power. It is good in the sense that everything is safe, dramatic, and stable, but there is no outstanding song, and it did not exceed my prior expectations, which left me with a somewhat disappointed feeling. I'll have to listen to it more and recognize its merits..."
4,"I bought this CD because my brother was listening to an omnibus album that included the song ""I'd do anything"" and I thought it was good. I usually listen to only female artists in Western music, so I don't know if this CD is better than others. But as I like ""Charcoal Filter"" and others, I found the pop and openness of the music very easy to listen to."
5,"I had high expectations for the DVD, but was a little disappointed that it was shorter than I expected. However, I am glad I bought the import version, which is less expensive than the Japanese version."
4,"Like the previous album, this album does not have the same immediate effect as Yumegen Awake or Maou Dai-ten, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it. It was an album that had no songs that I could throw away, but if I had to pick out my favorites, I would have to say ""Sixteen Nights of Rain,"" ""Peacock Ninpocho,"" ""Hikka,"" and ""Kumikyoku ~Kubio~. Especially, ""Sixteen Nights of Rain"" is a killer chain in my opinion. The development leading from the tapaku to the aoki dokugan is also quite a hateful performance. (Baku sounds a bit like Shutting from the sky by Lark...is it just me?) However, like the previous album, if they mainly play songs from this album at live shows, the atmosphere will be a little too calm... For the next album, I would like to see more intense songs (preferably with death voice) and ballads written by Kurokeneko. I think that since they are a metal band, they should have more intense songs. It's about time for an album that surpasses ""Yumegen Awagage""...."
2,"The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, a group of greats, I had high expectations for how great they would be, but I got the impression that they had no personality, that they became more like Albarn, more like Gorillaz, more like the atmosphere of old London, and that was the end. The bass player (Crash), drummer, and guitarist (ex-Verve) were all in a bad way, not very lively, and the music was uninteresting. There was no sense of fun. So, I don't feel sentimental or enjoy listening to them. What was the point of assembling the biggest names? However, the last song ""The Good, The Bad And The Queen"" is a masterpiece. It is amazing. This song fulfilled the musician's duty to give the audience a cathartic experience."
2,"I was disappointed with this Album because I had to wait so long.  Since he started to devote his energy to movies, his style and tune has changed and he is no longer a zombie.  I don't know if he will release his next album, but let's hope for the next one."
5,"It may be my own personal taste, but I was completely won over by the music upon first listen. It has a worldview that is so different from the rest that it is both cool and intense. The beat that steals your heart to a precise degree, the blackness of the vocals, the noisy guitars, etc. are in perfect harmony, and the tense atmosphere that feels as if it is about to break off at any moment is unbearable. It is not just a vigorous or hard passion, nor a depressing darkness, but a coolness that has a very real uplifting effect. As an album, it is well-balanced and flows very well, perhaps my best work in recent years."
4,"David~ Byne's fifth release on Ruakabap. Since becoming a solo project, Byne's music has become more hip-hop and soul than the world music of the past, but here we see the fruits of his past activities. In addition to the previous lineup, there is a steady stream of neo-soul that has become new flesh and blood. This is a truly borderless album that transcends genres! Of course, there is no doubt that this is the best album of his career. Another rich harvest of music has been born. ~~~Music"
2,"Dylan's new albums released only six months apart (this is the third time since 1965 and 1970 that new albums have been released six months apart). It is a charity album, with proceeds in the U.S. going to Feeding America (the nation's largest food aid organization), proceeds in the U.K. going to Crisis UK, and proceeds in other countries going to the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in perpetuity. 　The CD will be available in deluxe and standard editions, and there are plans to release an LP at the end of November. The deluxe edition will come in (1) a paper slipcase, (2) a Christmas greeting card and envelope; the greeting cards will be the same size and design as the CD jacket (5 pairs), and (3) no lyrics card or recording data (members, date, etc.). (3) There were no lyric cards or recording data (such as members, date, etc.). It seems that it is not necessary to buy at least the deluxe version. 　As for the contents, the arrangement is very orthodox, with a selection of traditional songs and Christmas standards from the 1930s to 1960s, backed by a very Caucasian chorus. Dylan's voice is particularly distinctive on this arrangement. Dylan's voice is so bad that it sounds as if he's ""sputtering phlegm. Dylan's voice is so bad that it sounds as if he's ""phlegm-ridden,"" and he doesn't even sound right in the first place. The reason why it seems too much as usual is probably because the theme is too orthodox: ""Christmas songs""? To put it mildly, it gives the impression of being a ""work in progress"" and ""not good enough. The sexy illustration of 1950s playmate Bettie Page on the back cover is a joke in bad taste. I am a fan of Dylan's music and have all of his albums, and I gave the previous album a 5 star rating, but I can't recommend this one."
2,"What is this? I don't know about this, but Nakajima's voice doesn't match the gorgeous backing instruments and chorus. It floats too much. Couldn't he have changed his singing style to match the mood of each song? The second song is also kind of meh. I don't want to say that it is better than the original, but it is not expressive enough. The song doesn't use the same emotions. I was not moved by the lyrics. To be honest, I didn't think it was good."
1,Another crap album....  What do you want to do?  Nothing good comes out of the mainstream anymore.
5,"I'm listening to the UK version of the CD released in 2000, but the sound quality changes drastically around the 50 second mark of the third track."
5,"I always feel the depth and warmth of Ms. Hirai's world. The lyrics come through naturally, and her voice is mysterious and comforting."
1,"I disliked her. The first best was good, but after that.... I sometimes listen to her on ringtone full or something, but I don't feel anything. She is just a robot. I don't know why, she just sings the songs well. I thought he didn't make the songs his own. I listen to songs by Ayu and others because I like them, but she makes them her own. That is her weakness. I don't want this single. It's not fresh."
1,"Fate is good, but I'm not sure what BUT is trying to tell us? This is way overpriced. I also wish they had included the unreleased ""Get It On""."
5,"It is also sung in the concert tour I am currently doing, and it is a very complete album. I think many people will fall in love with Naotaro after listening to this album. Even if you only know Naotaro's song ""Sakura,"" this is a must-listen."
2,"I like her as an actress, but not as a singer. What do you think singing is, that you debut so easily when you are not even a good singer? It's no wonder she has a low reputation."
2,"This is the best of Hori Chiemi's singles, 16 songs selected from all of her singles and recorded on a single CD. Her debut was in 1982, and her last single was in 1987, making a total of five years of activity, but even listening to the songs now, there is no wasted time, and there is always something worth listening to. The most important musical element, so to speak, is the sublimation of the phrases, which are well-crafted and fleshed out with various instruments, into idol pop songs. As he himself says, his voice sounds a little strained due to a throat trouble, but it is a good thing that he has a good taste for it. However, as she approached the latter half of the show, the content of the songs became more difficult to understand, and some of the poems and the composition of the songs were difficult to interpret. I wish she would have continued with the same style as before, since she had such good material."
1,"There is no way that the same songs would be played in succession at a live concert...but this CD, with its insensitive editing of the same songs in succession, honestly reduces the charm of the work by half. Couldn't they have at least edited the songs in the regular order and put the bonus track at the end? It is a miraculous masterpiece that can be listened to for a lifetime, so I hope that those who will encounter this album in the future will buy another version of the CD (such as the US SACD version now available) that takes such considerations into account. So, I give one star with anger to the person who made this edit."
5,"Although it was not easily available on CD at first (Your All I Need was the first in Japan, I think), I am glad to see a double-disc release, or rather, an album that you should buy. Their breathtaking duets are ""true love songs"". A simple but profound love duet. Tammy! Marvin! and happy - fighting songs, etc., are sung with a lot of emotion. Marvin has duets with other artists, but this duet with such a wonderful partner, Tammy, is a must-hear. It is an old but constant duet of love."
5,"It was playing in a CD store. I seriously thought it was a foreign artist. The Japanese part also ""disappears the meaning"" in a way and comes in as a sound. I recommend it."
4,"This album is known for containing ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" Yumi's biggest single hit ever. Conversely, the fact that the other songs are not featured much probably contributes greatly to its big hit. The third song, ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" is in the style of an old song, and seems to play off Yumi, who dares to sing this kind of song as her favorite. It's not bad, but it's a bit complicated for a fan when this song was the highest selling single. The quality pop music heard on the sixth track, ""April Fool's Day in November,"" is very Yumi. The song is overshadowed by the excellent lyrics of her younger days, and I think it would have been an applause-worthy song if it had been developed a little differently. The arrangement is well done and the song was a lovely example of Yumi's loveliness. I like the moist Yumi world as sung in the tenth song, ""Two Pirates,"" and I listen to it over and over again. It was the time when the lyrics had less depth than before, and I felt that the song was playing with changes, so the arpeggio played by the electronic piano in the prelude gave me a good premonition that this was a good song. The song is also full of emotion, and this is the kind of song that fans have been waiting for. The psychedelic illustrations used in the leaflet and on the CD, which were popular around 1970, are eye-catching, but they do not link well with the images of the songs on the album. It may have been the time when Yumi, who had been releasing albums for many years, began to show signs of running out of steam. Still, it is a million-seller record, which is quite impressive."
5,"It is a wonderful song, although it seems to be a bit light among Mr. Nakajima's songs. I personally listened to this song when I was heartbroken, so I have deep memories of it. It makes me sad when I listen to it. I recommend it when you want to fall in love."
5,"I am not an expert on Kobukuro, but this song makes me cry no matter how many times I listen to it! The lyrics, the voice, the melody, and the arrangement all match up beautifully with what I imagined, and I especially love the melody of the chorus. I really think this song will still be requested 10.20 years from now. If you haven't heard it, please give it a listen. It should not be a loss."
1,"It was very good...but the quality has dropped drastically since UN ROCK Star...it was good in the beginning...by the way, it is very expensive...obviously if you have to buy two copies, it would have been better if it was a two-disc set for around 3,000...and I don't think the bad rating here is a criticism. I wish it was around 3,000 for a two-disc set... Also, I don't think the bad reviews here are criticism. It's just people's opinions."
5,"This is a work by a band with a female vocalist who is intriguing for some reason. Not intense, but not too quiet either, is the position. I immediately thought of Suzanne Vega. A CCM hit album. 6 out of 10."
5,"The B has been replaced by John Brand since the last album, but the sound itself has not changed at all. If I had to say something, I would say that the sound has become more refreshing. When Robin Zander sings, it's CHEAP TRICK. That said, I love this album. I love this album, because the sound has become a little more sophisticated and sophisticated. Unfortunately, the times have changed and the world has forgotten all about CHEAP TRICK. It will be a while before the later revival. But what I appreciate is that the sound didn't change at all, regardless of whether it sold well or not. In a way, it is similar to AC/DC."
5,"Not only is the title song ""Kazetachinu"" wonderful, but the other two songs are also wonderful songs that make us listen to them slowly. Thank you Naka-sama for always continuing to provide us with such wonderful good songs."
1,"I thought they couldn't be combined into a single bgm? As far as I know, there were probably 5.6 bgm's in the original. The bgm editor did too well with ""Saraba"", didn't he? The bgm editor did too well with the sarabas, but after that, there was nothing to talk about. Part 1 and Saraba were good, Part 2 and Alternative were also good, and Part 3 is also good. However, Twani and Kanketsuhen are not good. But the Twani and Kanketsuhen are not good. It takes too much time to make new ones, so here we are again. But it is essential for the collection, isn't it?"
5,"Guitarist with the No. 1 studio career. He is an accomplished studio musician, player, and composer who has recorded and toured with numerous artists both in Japan and abroad. I have seen him play guitar up close and personal, and he is an exceptional guitarist who is far beyond the level of being good, having technique, or having good taste. Recently, he has been playing pedal steel guitars (tabletop guitars) with two necks. This is his only original album under the name of ""Tsuyoshi Kon. You can enjoy his sound from ZIG-ZAG to DEAR SUNTORY. His slide guitar is superb. The famous song ""Agatha"" can be seen on Youtube. The new album is also highly anticipated after 30 years."
5,"Twenty-five years ago, Satoshi Terao made a guest appearance on Bunka Hoso's late-night program ""Running Songs,"" as he was about to release an album called Reflections.　The personality that day was Fumi Hirano.　He was the voice actor who later voiced Ram-chan in Urusei Yatsura.　Shadow City"" was introduced as one of Terao's albums that Hirano fell in love with.　He loved it so much that he bought the Reflections album and listened to it over and over again.　In response to Hirano's question, Terao replied, ""I made this album for men to listen to on their way home after work. I thought it was a very clever line.　As you know, Terao's subsequent breakthrough came after that. I heard that a re-arranged version of ""Reflections"" had been released, and I immediately bought it. Terao's voice was the same, but the arrangement was a little more lively and slightly different. But what is this freshness?　I couldn't help but smile when I noticed the new arrangement.　Many singers these days are very good singers (some of them are like SMAP), and Terao is not a very good singer, but he makes us listen to his music."
5,"This is the song that you and your fans clapped to when you went to a live concert before. I remember it. I never thought this song would become a single. It is a cheerful and uplifting song. The lyrics are truly Naotaro's! I haven't bought the CD yet, but I can't wait to buy it. I haven't bought the CD yet, but I can't wait to buy it and listen to it in good sound."
4,"It is a double disc set of DVD and CD. Anyway, if you like BEYONCE, this is a must-have item."
5,"Destiny's Child is now sold in pieces, and the biggest budget is spent on the singer who is most likely to sell the most. So, this singer has a good chance of remaining as a pin. If you listen to the album, you can hear that a lot of money was spent on recording. Her father used to manage Des Cha, so it is not surprising. This singer has a good style and is a gravure. And she is a good singer. So, her ""product value"" is quite high. She is also well prepared so as not to be eclipsed by big-name guests. The songs are well rounded and the quality of the album is quite high for a mainstream contemporary R&B album. 8 out of 10."
1,"This is the first FPM CD that made me think ""I shouldn't have bought it"". I've been listening to house music my whole life, and the only song on the CD that I was vaguely familiar with was ""Tokyo is..."". J-pop? What the heck is that? If so, I do not recommend this album at all. It did not make me dance in a groove, nor did it make me want to relax and have a cup of tea under the sun shining through the trees. I'm looking forward to the next one and Gran Turismo.... What's wrong with you, Mr. Tanaka...?"
2,"It was not good at all. It didn't look like YAMARASHI. It lost all the weird and dangerous atmosphere it had before.... 　I don't think those who prefer this to ""Unexperienced Zone"" are real YAMARASHI fans. 　I recommend HEAD BANG and give it 2 stars in the hope that the original YAMARASHI will come back again."
1,"Anyway, it is monotonous and sleepy."
1,"It's something~・・・・ KREVA has been a favorite of mine since the Byfer days, but it seems to lose depth or lightness with each passing year. This is too light. Not only the sound but also the lyrics. The world of Kreva's poetry should be deeper. I thought this album was shallow. If I say it's interesting, it is. But overall, there should be more songs of various colors. I thought. I love Bonnie Pink, but I don't think they made the best use of Bonnie Pink at all. I also thought, ""If this is the case, it doesn't matter which singer we ask. I love KREVA, though. I look forward to his next work."
2,"In conclusion, I wonder why they bothered to make a live recording of such a poorly performed performance."" I have seen all of their performances in Japan, and I have all of their videos and DVDs. I have seen all of their performances in Japan and have all of the videos and DVDs of their live performances, but this is the worst performance I have ever seen. Usually, Neil can sing better than this, but here, he couldn't control his voice as if he had a cold on that day. It was so sad to listen to. And as for the backing band, I understand that the main feature of this project is to perform with a live orchestra, but the timing was not right to the extent that I could tell they had not rehearsed well enough. It must have been difficult for both sides. When I heard a live performance of Metallica with an orchestra before, I was impressed by the amount of time spent on rehearsals and the skill of Michael Kamen, who conducted and arranged the performance. However, this performance shows that Trevor Horn is not good at directing a live performance, and that he is a man who is good only at editing recorded sound sources using a sampler or a synclavier. In addition, PSB's lack of sense of tone when using live drums is a major drag here as well, and this is one of the areas where he has lost out to the likes of Depeche Mode and New Order.... As for the song selection, the full version of ""Left To My Own Devices"" was performed with an orchestra, which was the full version from ""Introspective"", so it was powerful without question, but the setlist was quite sad without ""Being Boring"" and ""Go West"". It is also regrettable that the band left out ""Opportunities"" and ""New York City Boy,"" both of which have a strong attack that would have sounded great live. However, the guest Rufus Wainwright sings ""Casanova In Hell"" from the new album, which reminds me of Radiohead's ""No Surprises,"" and I was surprised that Neil brought a completely different impression to the song than when he sang it himself. Robbie Williams sings ""Jealousy"" with a lot of feeling, which is quite charming (in the documentary DVD of PSB, Robbie said that he used to listen to ""Behavior"" while riding his motorcycle in the middle of the night and that it was a very important album for him. Good story). I wish they would release the live videos of ""Discovery"" and ""Highlights"" on DVD as soon as possible, instead of this."
2,"Well, this is great content. The best of Vince Clark & Andy Bell, the long-lived unit Erasure. Digitally remastered in 2009. If you like Erasure, you'll love this 2 CD set! The cover is very good, like an inexpensive best of wagon-sale disc. On the back cover, you can see two oombs snuggling up to each other. Mwuhuhu.... On another best of album, there were also ducks cuddling with each other. Pop, pop, pop, pop. I was so bored by the end of the album, because they all sounded the same to me. However, A Little Respect, the ultimate 80's masterpiece, is fantastic! This song deserves to be in your collection. By the way, Erasure is not at all major in Japan. In the UK, they are a national idol? I guess Vince is a good one. Vince is a good choice, but Andy Bell is a bit of an abnormal man, I guess. I recommend the third album of Erasure, The Innocents, without any complaints."
5,"The second album was produced by Ross Robinson again. The sound has a strong essence of death metal, starting with ""People=Shit"" led by ""515"". 　While the previous album had a lot of punk feel to it, and as Sean's mask said, they could play with a smile on their face, this album is heavy with their complexes. 　The highlight is ""Iowa,"" where Joey's thrilling drumming is accompanied by an eerie sound effect that shows the gloomy side of Iowa, where the band grew up. 　If you are not accustomed to this kind of sound, you will be put out by the end of the show, but I hope you will evolve until you can hear this. 　I would have liked the DVD to have at least one additional Live song anyway."
2,"As the title suggests, the Gallagher brothers (or Noel, to be more precise) may have truly begun to feel the pressure of being compared to the Beatles and other famous bands of the past since then. Their music is often considered experimental, and their attitude toward trying something new is evident. Therefore, the melody-driven songs that were seen in their early days are not found in this album. OASIS is a band that rose to international fame because of their sense of melody, so it is not surprising that listeners' reactions were negative, and I could not say that I was satisfied with this album."
1,"This work is often treated as a masterpiece, but.... But honestly, I feel ""Is it that good? I feel it's not that good. I prefer ""Gates of Paradise"" by Fripp. Even Eno should buy ""Another Green World"" or something like that. And, unbelievably, I heard that this album sold quite well in the UK. I don't know about that. By the way, the startup sound of windows vista was composed by Fripp. If this work has the origin of that kind of music, it might be a little interesting to listen to it..."
5,"All the songs are good, but Neophilia! This song, which starts with a bass clarinet, really gets to me. Benny Maupin, Lee Morgan, Mickey Rocker, Harold Mayburn, and Jimmy Merritt all play like they are obsessed with something. I never get tired of listening to it over and over again. A masterpiece from Lee Morgan's final years."
5,"Listening to it from the beginning to the end gave me a very ""heavy"" feeling. In the drama, I was left with the feeling that it was just BGM for the story, but after listening to this CD, it was a completely different story, and I felt the weight of the greatness of human life with my ears. I hope many people will listen to this CD and feel it individually."
1,"I was a little further away from Remi with Horizon. Flash and Gleam took me even further away. What can I say? I'm not saying don't use orchestras or don't type. I just don't think it's good at all. It's too vague, but if it becomes ""normal"" like this, it loses its Remi-like quality. So, it's okay to be like everyone else and not be Remi. It's like, ""I don't need to be Remi. I couldn't feel the ""character"" of the music and the arrangement. Neither the music nor the arrangements."
4,"Positive songs such as ""After the Rain,"" ""Festa,"" and ""Morning Glory"" are good, but ""Tentacles,"" ""Showa,"" and ""Taxi Driver"" with a black taste are hard to ignore. Beer and Pudding"" and ""Telephone"" are must-listens. Remio's music makes you realize that ""reality"" is right in front of you, even if you don't like it. And after making you realize it, the music gently pushes you back. There is no ""sweetness,"" but it is ""gentle. Above all, there are not many bands whose bass performance stands out so much. The bass line is really cool. Basically, the songs on this CD have a great live groove, so please listen to them before going to a concert."
1,"~From this album, it's not worth listening to at all. I don't even want to give it a single star. I like the live performances and have been to a few in the past and bought the DVD,"
5,"DEPAPEPE has many energizing songs. The second song, Ready!GO! is a song that pushes you up when you listen to it at the time of departure or in the morning. The fourth song, ""Forbidden Love,"" which has a rather dark title, is also a song that expresses the joy of love without being heavy. 　The songs are not about technique or musicality, but more about the true joy of music. This is a piece overflowing with freshness and gentleness."
2,"You're pathetic! Sukima Switch! Making an album like this. I had a bad feeling about this album because of the postponement of its release, but I didn't think that their sensibility had dried up to this extent. I am not an unconditional fan of Sukima Switch. They seem kind of snarky, the title is flirtatious, and the lyrics are imo. But the twist in the song ""Galana"" made me think, ""Oh? I thought. Maybe they actually want to play sharper music? I don't have the spark of a genius, but I think I have a craftsman-like ""skill. So I was a bit excited about this album. But what the heck, did you peak with ""Galana""? Wasn't it ""Engine Full Throttle""? I thought ""Akatsuki no uta"" was a prelude single, and now this is the cleanup track? What the hell... And then there are the quirks, quirks, quirks. The inspiration has completely faded. The vocals are mostly singles. And how about the self-covers? Is he really prepared to re-sing the parts that were sung with such enthusiasm by the distinguished artists of ""Fukumimi""? You didn't mean to ""make up"" for it, did you? If this is the case, Flavored Hall's new album is definitely more impressive. Moreover, they have made a clear distinction between a single and an album. It's more of a conscience to the listeners than an artist's. This is an important point. This is the important part. A little more shtick! I look forward to the next one."
2,"I love Yusuke who appeared in the PV, so I give him 2 stars. I was wondering if Orange Range was still around. I was like, ""You're still here? After the strange groove of the last album, they are going to release a ballad? Can I put this in the category of ballad in the first place? I think Japanese people are really meek to use this song in a drama. I can't help but think that the people who support Orange Range have never listened to good quality music.... Sorry. But the initial momentum of the band is gradually disappearing. Japanese people are easily heated up and cooled down."
5,"Perhaps because I am also a Kansai native, I easily get used to the lyrics, and before I know it, I'm humming the tune. I think this will be one of the songs sung at weddings."
1,"I want you to stop. The way they sing, which seems like they are trying to be a target, combined with the commercials that have a second-rate atmosphere, makes me feel uncomfortable every time I listen to them. In addition to the cheesy lyrics, the singing ability is also mediocre. At any rate, I don't think it's worth buying."
5,"I am of the real-time generation. At the time, I had no money and went to a record rental shop! I recorded it on a cassette tape and listened to it until it ran out of steam! I recorded it on a cassette tape and listened to it until it ran out of juice. I hadn't listened to it for a long time, but the other day I heard it on the radio and thought it made me nostalgic, so I went to Amazon.com and listened to the latest album. Conclusion... ""Buy them all"". Regent brother, legitimate(?) Hard rock gentleman, punk kid, metal/death dude, thrasher, glam, grunge, psychedelic, southern.... If you don't like this, please give up calling yourself a ROCK lover. But I'm a little over the top, because this is real ROCK. Q. It's just one pattern. A. Of course it is, because we only do cool things. Q. It's too late. A. I understand how you feel. I also love high-speed riffs and listen to a variety of music. In that case, I think you should be satisfied with other artists. Q. I don't have any technique... A. When I was a kid, I thought so too. In a way, it is true, but in the end, whether or not ""ROCK is cool"" is all that matters.... 　　Even if you copy the music and play it live, you can't get close to that coolness. I used to play drums, so my attention was drawn to rhythm. AC/DC has an 8-beat rhythm, but I want to name it ""Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go"" and call it ""Rock 4 (Four). Don't hit back even if your parents die"" was a popular saying at that time (for more details, please refer to other brothers and sisters or Wikipedia, etc.). AC/DC is also good for driving. When you are looking for something loud and punchy, this is a good place to start. (It may not be suitable for a Lexus or something like that.)"
5,"Sorry for the cliché, but I thought this was the sound I was looking for. First of all, the vocalist, Aaron, is fantastic. His deep and deep voice pulls you into the song at once. His guitar playing is not flashy, but he plays a tasteful solo at some important points. Each solo is very moving. The rhythm section of bass and drums is also very good. In the chorus, the whole song is pushed up from the bottom. When the vocalist and guitarist pursue ""quiet beauty,"" the song tends to be ""beautiful but plain. Listening to this album makes me feel as if I were suffocating, but for some reason I find myself wanting to listen to it again. I recommend this album to those who want to listen to rock music slowly and carefully."
5,"I had never listened to rock music until I came across Sum41. But one day I was browsing a music site on my computer and heard ""Still waiting"" by Sum41 and thought it was good, so I bought it. I was looking at the DVDs and it looks like they are playing and doing stupid things, but actually they are thinking about the current social situation like ""Still waiting"" or ""The hell song"". I think it's great that they are thinking about the current social situation, like ""Still waiting"" or ""The hell song"", and I think that's great as an artist. Even if you haven't heard of this type of punk music, the lyrics are well written and clearly express what they are trying to say, so please pick it up."
5,"This song is the opening for the first season of the anime ""Shakugan no Shana"". This song ""Scarlet Sky"" is a good song that fits ""Shakugan no Shana"" very well.  And the promotional video, another attraction of the song, is also well done."
5,"I am a father of 8 year old twins, and the songs I can sing with my children (Bluebird, etc.) and the whole album is wonderful. I drive a lot at night on the highway because of my job, and I can't tell you how many times I've listened to this album to help me stay awake!"
1,"Each album has a different look and feel, but at its core, it is unique. I have always respected U2's art, but this time it was a little different. I can't listen to this album any more, not that it gets better every time I listen to it. Bono should quit being an artist and become a politician."
1,"I have been a fan of Ayumi Hamasaki for 9 years since ""LOVE~Destiny~"". I own all of her original albums, best albums, and singles, and I go to her live performances every year. However, this time I feel unforgivable and I want to say to avex (Ayumi Hamasaki), what is wrong with ""ALL SINGING""? What's with the ""ALL SINGLES""? I thought it was the first single limited to 300,000 copies, but it was an album version (but the jacket of the single version not included in the album was clearly printed on the package). No double A-sides, triple A-sides, or 4-track A-sides. This is not ""ALL SINGLES"", is it? He released three bests in a year and a half, saying that the first best was something special and not his intention this time, but it sold so well that he must have gotten a taste of the royalties. If you release five bests in ten years, it seems to me that you are just trying to make a profit after all. I thought that when the originals stop selling, the bests are the only way to go. It's a pathetic strategy that makes it hard to believe that they are the same maker as Namie Amuro. To be honest, it's a shame because I had high hopes for Ayumi Hamasaki. I bought it because I'm a fan, but it has become a decoration."
5,"The Beatles are changing their music since their last album ""Rubber Soul"", the top song ""Taxman"" is George's masterpiece, and Paul's bass is not to be missed. It is tight and very cool phrased, and the song ""I'm Only Sleeping"" uses the reverse rotation of the tape."
5,"John Lennon's masterpiece second album as well as his first solo album. The album starts with the majestic piano melody of ""1,"" which probably 2/3 of the human population on earth knows, and the rest of the album is a storm of great songs, including ""5"" and ""8,"" which are now only one of the old topics of conversation. But you should buy this album just to listen to the three great songs, 3 and 7, including the one I mentioned above."
4,"The gentle melody of ""ten"" will calm your mind on a Sunday afternoon with a book in your hand."
2,"I have been listening to Oda-san's music for many years. In order to grab new fans, a best-of album containing songs that have only recently been released would be easy to listen to. However, this time, as in the previous album, there are a few OFF COURSE covers and only songs from the last few years are included, making it unacceptable to old fans. Also, instead of the best album, they should have released an original album with unCDed songs such as CM Ichi (Hajime)'s songs."
2,"I immediately bought the CD and tried to listen to it, but it somehow did not feel right to me, as I am of the generation that knows WON'T BE LONG by the Bubblegum Brothers. I don't think this song is suitable for a male-female duet. Not that I have anything against Kumi Koda, but I think it would have been better suited to this song if EXILE sang it alone..."
1,"To be clear, I don't want this kind of thing to happen. The song itself is a good song, so it's no surprise that it sells well. I feel that the song is better before it was covered...."
5,"I have heard through the grapevine that many people, men and women, young and old, cry at their live performances. You are stirred up, you tremble, and when you realize it, tears are rolling down your cheeks. What is this? It's not a ballad. I'm screaming so loudly. What is this mysterious feeling? Ever since I first learned of this pleasure, I have not been able to take my eyes off of them. The question mark of ""Why do we cry?"
1,"Purchased this along with ACT2. That one was great, but this one.... I honestly don't think it's something you should buy and listen to. If you are interested, why don't you just rent it? I recommend buying it only for collectors."
1,"For fans who have completed the albums and singles to some extent, I wonder which are the rare tracks. For those who are just starting to listen to the music, I guess it is good."
5,"I bought this album for the first time when I was in college. It is full of great songs, but I especially like No selfcontrol, Let's go to the place to check, Bran-new lovesong, and Paper Triangle. I remember I got goosebumps when I heard all of them. If this album doesn't work for you, I think you are not compatible with the PILLOWS. However, if you get hooked on this album, you should buy and listen to other albums as well."
4,"It is a good piece.　 John Mayer, who had played with a very tasteful yet solid technique on the first and second albums, has included a lot of the ""guitar playing"" elements in this album.　 The songs may be a bit plain, and those who want the feel of the first album may be turned off.... But there are songs that make you think that they are progressing with new ideas, approaches, etc.　 The guitar playing is full of great blues based playing, just like Rayvaughn's glue on the live album called ""Try""!　　 Anyway, it's a mature work that gets better every time you listen to it!　 P.S. The imported version is more balanced as an album (of course), but the bonus tracks on the Japanese version are also hard to throw away!　 Please think carefully before you buy it!"
2,"A collaboration mini-album between BECR and YOUR SONG IS GOOD. I was a little disappointed to hear BECR's previous album, DAY AFTER DAY, because I felt it was a little less sharp. However, I quite like NOTHING TO LOSE, which is BECR's solo album. Some of the songs in the album are covers of HIT IN THE UAS in the style of Kukamimi Japanese, so you might want to give it a listen. But I still prefer BEAT CRUSADERS' solo works."
5,I was able to watch the DVD at home. I like it. I think it was a good purchase.
1,"There is nothing in the way of unearthed material, unreleased songs, hard-to-find B-sides, etc., and it is just the best of the best. I'm not sure who would buy it, since an enthusiast would have all the albums."
5,"The success of their experiments with ""Atom Heart Mother"" enabled Pink Floyd to pursue their own musicality. This album is from the period when they were at their most cohesive as a band. The warmth of sunlight can be felt throughout the album, and it seems to be a counterpart to the masterpiece ""Madness"". Gilmour's guitar explodes on ""Blow, Wind, Call, Storm,"" ""Fearless,"" and ""A Pillow Of Winds,"" which led to their later works, and other quality pieces. However, this album is limited to ""Echoes,"" and this song is the best song on the album. This song transcends the concept of psychedelic or progressive music, and gives us ""Pink Floyd music"". I want you to close your eyes and listen to this song. You will feel as if you are on a trip through the universe. However, the time when this album is called a masterpiece will soon be over. The time for this album to be called a masterpiece will soon be over, because the soundtrack album ""Shadow of the Clouds"" will be followed by the release of ""Madness"" (which is my favorite album). Who would have thought that only four years after the release of this album, an album as dark as ""Flames"" would be released?"
2,"She looks like Brandy!!!!"" Mary J. Blige once said so after seeing her music video. I don't know if that's why, but it's very different from her original music. I think her fans might be confused."
5,"It's badass. ......... It's just cool. The twin guitars are so powerful! Even if you like old V-kei, D is different. Just listen to it and you will understand. You'll understand it when you hear it. The instruments are well balanced and the vocals are good. However, some people may not like their voice because it is a little bit peculiar. It's worth a listen."
1,"My lyric is ""I'm dropping atomic bombs like Hiroshima and Nagasaki."" It's part of the lyrics of LIKE THAT."
2,"Most of what's in it has already been published, including tributes to ""Madness"" and ""The Wall"". Therefore, I give it 2 stars. Of course, no matter how good the actors are, there is no way they can compete with the original. Lukather's intro to ""Shine On"" is hilarious. In that sense, I feel sympathy for the bold arrangement of the newcomers. By the way, the back cover says ""Dedicated to the memory of Syd Barrett. Yet there is no Syd song. If you are going to spend your money on this, you might as well spend it on Gilmour's ""Haikyo""."
1,"In the context of techno, German prog rock stories such as Manuel Götting's E2E4 are often mentioned as roots, and UFO by Guru Guru was mentioned frequently among them, so I was curious and bought it... I bought it because I was curious about it... This is a rock band. I bought it expecting to hear the flowing synth phrases that are often found in German music, but it was something else entirely. So, if you are thinking of going back to techno like me, be careful."
5,"First of all, I would like to thank Lark for giving me the great song ""Seventh Heaven"", even though I have always listened only to Western music. I would also like to thank all the fans who have continued to support this band. This album is very complete. The first song is ""SEVENTH HEAVEN""! What's next? What's next? Swallowed by the dizzying flood of changing sounds, we finish listening to the last song, ""Hurry Xmas"". I am filled with an indescribable feeling of happiness. I am glad to have met Lark. I highly recommend this album to those who have disliked Japanese music, or even Lark, due to preconceived notions."
4,"First of all, it should be noted that the style of this work is a ""complete classical-style opera,"" not a ""rock opera. Therefore, those who have never been exposed to ""classical-style opera"" (i.e., so-called ""ordinary opera"") are in great danger of missing the point. Also, because of the style of the music, those who expect ""Roger Waters' style"" will be betrayed. 　In other words, when you listen to this work, you must have the attitude that you are listening to ""a new opera of more than two hours in length, in the traditional style of the 21st century. To put it more simply, if you listen to this work without any preamble, you will probably feel that it is a ""new opera in the orthodox style. 　The question then becomes, ""How should we evaluate this work?"" Do we think of it as ""a new opera in the traditional style by a rock musician"" or ""a new opera in the traditional style by a talented composer""? In other words, depending on whether you think of it as ""a traditional opera as a development of rock opera"" or ""a new opera without preamble,"" the way you think of it will be completely different. 　If you take the strictest view, i.e., ""a new opera (without any preamble by famous rock musicians, etc.),"" I felt that it was ""an easy listening opera faithful to the pre-19th century tradition without any mistakes. Since I like opera, I was able to listen to it without any sense of discomfort, except for the fact that it was written in English, and it was not difficult to understand, as is usually the case with new operas. Rather, I felt that it was an excellent work, comparable to a classical opera. 　I can fully understand how he came to this kind of music as a result of his own musical development, but it is a pity at this point that I cannot see anything that only he could have created. Incidentally, there is no splendid commentary by Naoki Tachikawa on this work. I think it is the responsibility of critics to provide commentary for such a problematic work."
5,"This is how rock 'n' roll should be. There is no need for musical theory, logic, author's backbone, background, historical background, lyric cards, Japanese translations, liner notes, song titles, or anything else. Everything can be abbreviated as ""nosebleed. Just take out the CD, put it in the audio player, and press play. That's it. Whether it's on the bed, the flooring, the tatami mats, the street, or the dance floor, all you have to do is dance. All you have to do is move. Just shake. Just enjoy the movement. The explosive power of the dance is, after all, wonderful. Excessive affirmation, affirmation, affirmation. An anthem for life without any impurities. The stench of humanity that has been exposed to the light of day and has been pushed forward. We are human beings, why don't we dance? Even if there is nothing to be happy about, nothing to celebrate, just dance. That's all there is to it. That's all there is to it, and it's worth it."
4,"This is truly an introduction to the Machine Guns, a collection of classic songs that still play a central role in their live shows. The album is full of themes and emotions that will appear again and again in future songs, such as melancholy, absurdity, laughter, and manliness, which cannot be expressed in the four words ""joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure,"" not to mention vigor and heat."
2,"The musical content is unquestionable, and for a rock album, it is a world-class monster album that has sold over 20 million copies. I bought it this time for some reason, and it is terrible. The ultimate in cruelty. I could see how the Japanese makers of this album don't understand the feelings of the listeners. I can't read the lyrics at all. They are too small. They are not on the lyrics card, but printed on the inside of the paper jacket. Are you kidding me? Well, it's fine for foreigners, isn't it? You understand English, right? But this is Japan. It's really commercialism in full swing. If you have the energy to put so much energy into something that has a bunch of logos and other nonsense, please do something better on the inside. So, if I were to say that this album meets the conditions sufficient for me to purchase it, I would give it zero stars. However, I'll give it at least two stars because it's disrespectful to my beloved Metallica."
5,"This song is the late ending theme for the TV Tokyo anime ""Saiyuki RELOAD""."
2,"I was honestly immensely impressed when I heard the first song.... If you don't tell me their name, I wouldn't know that this band is ""maroon 5"". The bluesy songs of the first album are all gone. To put it in an easy-to-imagine way, all the songs are like Sunday Morning from the first album. The quality itself is not bad, but it is the result of pushing adult rock in the wrong direction. I give this album 2 stars in the faint hope that they will go back to their roots in the next album."
5,"There is a Japanese Jazz musician who says that ""Kind of Blue,"" the best-selling Jazz album in the world, may become a synonym for Jazz. Some Japanese JAZZ musicians say that in a few decades from now, when introducing JAZZ to the world, it may even be possible to exclude other genres, such as bebop by Charlie Parker, etc., from this category. Be that as it may, Kind of Blue. It is a quiet, stylish and urban sound in a restrained mood among Miles' albums. The mood is a bit blue, as the title suggests. I listened to this album dozens of times when I was a teenager. In a word, it is one of the best looking Miles albums. The songs on this album, starting with ""So What? (So What?), a phrase Miles was fond of saying, is always in my head. Miles always brought new ideas to the Jazz world, even in his last years. It is also true that many musicians listened to this album and got various hints from it. When Miles passed away, Keith Jarrett famously lamented, ""Who will be providing ideas from now on? There is a frightening amount of commentary about this album, such as the fact that it was the album that established the modal technique. But listen to this sound with an open mind. I hope you will enjoy the refined and delicate sound that Miles never changed throughout his life. And for the younger listeners, I hope you will also listen to the albums of the 70's, 80's, and 90's of this genius musician, who went into the ""unexplored regions of music"" and created a sound that is always astonishing."
4,"Many people agree that Pavement's music has reached a state of perfection. At the time, it was described as a white album in the Pavement style, and it is true to that description, with a rich variety of songs. It is difficult to say whether there is a sense of unity as an album or not, but it is a group of 18 songs. That is typical of Pavement. That's just one word to describe it, but it's probably the only word that can be used to describe it. My personal favorites are ""We Dance"", ""Flux=Rad"", and ""Pueblo""."
2,"Underworld, a band I like very much, but the more they release albums, the more boring they become. This album is a complete second-guessing of their previous album, ""Beaucoup Fish"" (""Everything, Everything"" is a live performance, so I don't consider it as their previous album). Personally, I was disappointed to hear it. Sure, there are a lot of albums worse than this one. But it's sad to witness the end of a great band!"
5,"This is the first album by TEN, a band from the UK that has been active while undergoing various member changes. The album was originally produced as an album by Gary Hughes, a solo singer, but when Vinnie Barnes, formerly of DARE, joined the band, it was released as the band TEN. Gary's unique melancholy vocals and Vinnie's melancholy guitar color the songs. The HR songs ""After the Love Has Gone"" and ""Lamb to the Slaughter,"" the pop songs ""Stay with Me"" and ""Can't Slow Down,"" the ballads ""Yesterday Lies in the Flames"" and ""The Loneliest Place in the The songs are so well-developed that there is no end to the list of my favorites. Compared to later albums, the length of the songs is generally kept compact, and many of the pop songs are probably the easiest to listen to. Co-produced by Mike Stone and Gary, who are also famous for having worked on QUEEN and JOURNEY. This is one of the representative albums of the now deceased ZERO Corp."
2,"While the album has the standout hits, the rest of the songs are not well selected. The emphasis is on the message of the poetry rather than the sound, which is heavy and makes me feel depressed. The order of the songs is also so random that it does not flow comfortably. What is even worse is that the single version of the classic song ""Smooth Operator"" is included. I don't recommend this best-of album even for Shady beginners. The jacket is also not good looking."
2,ASIN: B002GU5V24 is Region 1. Please note.
4,"Slapp Happy's second album released by Virgin in the UK. The version recorded in Germany with the members of Slapp Happy (later released under the title """") was rejected, and this album was re-recorded in a more ""pop"" style. And while music fans with good taste are supposed to appreciate ""Slapp Happy"" as better than ""Slapp Happy,"" let's listen to this recording once again. Casablanca Moon,"" featuring a violin and emphasizing tango-style rhythms, and ""Dawn,"" with its brass fanfares and light drumming, create a strangely cheerful atmosphere, and are enjoyable as different versions from the original version. enjoyable as a different version. On the other hand, there are songs like ""Half Way There,"" with its drastically different instrumentation, where the original version has a more cohesive sound and is a more complete song. And, as can be said for the entire Virgin album, the arrangements are disparate, and the sound quality of Dagmar's vocals and the backing band's performance is fuzzy, and the drums, bass, and guitar deviate from the usual pop performance style. I think it is more weird and underground than ""Acnalbasac Noom,"" which has been put on the shelf because of its ""avant-garde"" nature. I think that this Virgin release is much more for the enthusiasts. However, Dagmar Krause sings in a more subdued or whisper-soft voice, which is only heard on this album, so fans are welcome to listen to it. But it's still for the enthusiasts!"
2,"Ark Enemy is a death metal band that has attracted a great deal of attention among current HM fans. Wage of Sin"" is regarded as one of their best works. The main point of this album is, needless to say, the change of members from Johan Riva to a female death metal singer, Angela Gossow. This album is a success overall, but it is also a controversial album that has been criticized by fans of the earlier generation."
5,"This piece focuses on the ultimate ""sound"" of the guitar, the ""mustang."" The ultimate sound can be heard in the song ""Restaurant"". The bare electric sound of the guitar, which is as good as the Ventures' ""Mosrite,"" is wonderful. At the time, I thought the music was incomprehensible, but listening to it now, it is a good album that expresses the diversity of CHAR's music in a straightforward manner. From a guitarist = CHAR's point of view, the wah-wah solo on ""Cloudy Sky"" is one that I would not be ashamed to show anywhere in the world. This song clearly surpasses Jimi Hendrix."
2,"Certainly, this album seems to have increased their recognition in the U.S., and I think they should be commended for their achievement in the charts. However, I am sorry to say that the European atmosphere from their debut album, or even from the LAZY era (Spaceship Earth!), has completely disappeared. I am sorry to say, however, that the European atmosphere from the LAZY era (Spaceship Earth!) has completely disappeared from the band. I liked the damp and dark atmosphere of the early days. Personally... I like ""Makai Kosho""!"
5,"Before its release, I heard ""BATTERY"" on the radio by Masanori Ito and was amazed! I was so excited. I rushed out and bought the 1st and 2nd CDs (LPs and King Record vinyls, naturally, since they were released at that time). Anyway, it was amazing. It's so cool. That's all I can say. I heard that some of the reviews by young people were negative, but I myself often wonder if I am wrong when I listen to so-called masterpieces afterwards. But I often think ""What the heck is this? However, when something like this is released in the atmosphere of the time, I can only bow down to it. I am so glad that I was in high school at that time. I am still listening to METAL music and I am OK with extreme music because this ALBUM is in my blood. However, compared to today's sound, it sounds old. The level of sound pressure (though it jumps off the page as music) is also low. The SHM-CD is indeed like a thin skinned, bare sound. But I'm hoping for a remaster anyway!"
2,"I bought it with faint expectations of the reputation of a well-known specialized newspaper, but to be frank, it was too subtle. I was deceived again. I was fooled again. There were some parts that I thought were good at the moment, but I would listen to other albums if I had to listen to this one. If you like the early works, you can buy it used for about half the price and you'll be satisfied."
5,"I think Dave Grohl is the only rock musician in recent years who can really feel such passion in his shouts. DISC 1 is a masterful burst of Fufi, and in a good way, it's as energetic as usual! It's as energetic as usual, but in a good way: the mellow catchiness of the 3rd album and the hard-hitting hardness of the 4th album. The overall result is a good mix between the mellow catchiness of the 3rd and the hard-hitting hardness of the 4th. Overall, the album is accessible to a wide variety of rock listeners. The hard number ""Free Me,"" reminiscent of Inafspace, and the melodic mid-tempo ""Resolve"" are quite good. In contrast, DISC2 is a surprise. I was expecting only peaceful acoustic numbers under a blue sky, but I was wrong. As other reviewers have written, there is an atmosphere of autumnal calm and a bit cold. Miracle"" featuring John Paul Jones (ZEP) on piano and ""Cold Day in the Sun"" with drummer Taylor on vocals are very gentle."
5,First solo album by Susanna Hoffs of BANGLES.
2,"The overall balance is good, and there were a few memorable songs, but honestly, it's not enough. This is #1 in the US? I feel that American music has been completely inferior to British music in recent years. This work is not even a footnote to the new ""KINGS OF LEON"" and ""RAZORLIGHT"" albums."
4,"This second album seems to be an evolution of the first one. The songs are more polished, with moist, weepy melodies that seem to come from deep within. Many of Red's songs are slow and sticky in tempo, and few are up-tempo. All songs are strongly sung, so they are different from ballads. It is the successor to the so-called Linkin Park, but the powerful and sad atmosphere is very Red-like. Also, the cheap price is quite favorable. However, the problem with this album is that it is an extension of the first one. In extreme cases, even if you shuffle the songs around, it doesn't sound any different. If you listen to it, the sound is more spread out than the first album, and there are more impressive melodies. From a slightly different point of view, I am concerned that there are no songs that lead to the next album, the 3rd album, which makes me look forward to the next album. It may be easy to get tired of listening to the same kind of songs."
5,"There are several points that make John Coltrane a distinguished jazzman. A giant like him is a player on a scale of ideas and principles that goes beyond the level of simply playing great music. However, even if we praise Coltrane as a distinguished saxophonist in the 1960s, his challenge to the soprano saxophone and his vision to play the pop tune ""My Favorite Things"" faster and with more individuality than any other saxophonist can be cited as his most significant achievements. The challenge of playing the soprano saxophone, and the superbly original and unique performance of the pop tune My Favorite Things, are still the most significant achievements of Coltrane. The familiar melody and the aloof sound of the soprano saxophone astonished many jazz fans. This album is a celebration of Coltrane's entrance into the 60's, and it is also the starting point for his endless performances of these songs. But in a monumental sense, this performance has never faded away and stands as a milestone in Coltrane jazz."
5,"Even if you are not a fan of hard rock, you can easily listen to this album. It is probably the most pop-oriented of all Ingvay's works. This may not be enough for the old fans."
5,"I have a deep attachment to the band Def Leppard. The band is a hard rock band, and this album itself is a monster album, their fourth album in total, with three hit songs, which sold worldwide. In fact, the drummer of this band is a one-armed drummer. The reason why he is one-armed is that his left arm was amputated in a car accident during the recording of this album, and it was thought that he would never recover as a drummer, but thanks to his own will and with the cooperation of Simmons, a drum company, he completed an electric drum and made a miraculous comeback. He made a miraculous comeback. He distributed the work of his left arm to both legs, and with hard work and perseverance + α, he was able to crawl up to the top. In fact, I was also moved when I saw his drum performance on stage at the time of his comeback, which was featured on Masanori Ito's TV program. And from this album, he has been playing drums with only one stick, and I can only say that his one-armed drumming on all the songs on the album is so brilliant. Especially, the third song, ""Animal,"" is a must listen. Whenever I listen to this album and think about this drummer, I can forget all the bad things I have been through. And lastly, please keep in mind the name of the one-armed drummer, Rick Allen. As a side note, the band debuted in 1980, and Rick was 16 years old at the time."
5,"I don't need to write about this album any more! I want to say that this album is so good that I don't need to say anything about it anymore! Unlike their previous albums, the momentum of the band itself is vacuum-packed into this single CD, and from the very first song, it has a tremendous groove that dominates the listener's ears! So, naturally, the recorded sound is also very good! I would like you to listen to it at a very loud volume...or rather, your hands will be turning up the volume on their own! With the exception of the first album, this is a must-hear for those who have outgrown the easy-going rock that everyone loved up until the last album!"
5,"It has been quite a while since I listened to this album, and I have yet to find another album that surpasses it! I especially like #1, #4, #3, and #13. I especially like #1, #4, #3, and #13. I'm drawn to this album just by hearing the first ""a-ha"" voice in rock from #1. So I don't think this album can be used as background music! (lol) Even if you try to play it as background music, I think there is something about this album that makes you listen to it. #2 suddenly changes and takes on a punk tone. Courtney sings the lyrics as she throws them into the melody, and it's really cool. The song #3 becomes a ballad and I think #4 is the best song on the album! The lyrics are very impressive and stay with you long after the song is over. The melody gets faster and faster in the latter half of the song, and Courtney's anguished voice makes me melt as she desperately sings the song. Courtney wrote the lyrics for all the songs, so I could feel her enthusiasm after the breakup of Hole. I can't wait for her to complete her second solo album. The jacket of the Japanese edition is a very beautiful picture by Ai Yazawa, but it is made of paper, which is a little disappointing. There are many teen girls singing rock songs nowadays, but I don't think there are any teen girls who can surpass Courtney. Courtney is the only woman who has the nickname ""Queen of Rock and Roll"" and I adore her."
2,"The way of expression may have changed, but basically, nothing new has been done. They just changed the tuning of the guitar and eliminated rapping, but musically there is not much change. As others have written, we can't help but feel the shallowness of their musical backbone. In the end, music is only about whether or not it is good when you listen to it without thinking about how difficult it is to understand. I am sorry to say that I didn't feel anything from this band. I've said a lot of things about it, but I don't think it's bad."
5,"For a first album, this is a very accomplished album. It is no exaggeration to say that a new hard rock was born with the emergence of these four musicians."
1,"I got hooked on Zeppelin about 10 years ago and listened to it every day for about 2 years at that time. I got tired of it and haven't listened to it recently, but I bought it with the expectation that it was a re-mastering. At first glance, the sound quality seems clear and good, but when I listen to it with my audiophile high-performance amp and speakers, I find that Zeppelin's unique undulating groove or jazz-like dynamism, tension, and airiness are gone, and the musicality is lost. The ""Stairway to Heaven"" is easier to listen to with the noisy cracked bass sound removed, but still, overall, the previous 2-CD remastering is definitely better due to the aforementioned problems. It's a pity that the live sound is so mixed and produced."
5,"It is an undistorted fact that Elton's voice range is extremely narrow and his voice quality is low. This is not surprising from the point of view of vocal medicine, as Elton is actively performing so many concerts a year and participating in other artists' CDs and concerts, making full use of his vocal cords (where does he get this kind of energy? Hats off to him.) My point is that Elton is writing songs for his current ""vocal range"". Even a high pitched song like ""Tiny Dancer"" from ""Madman Across the Water"" released in his younger days, if he has a wide vocal range, he can write such a great song freely. ""Elton has been a great performer for 100 years,"" he says. I seriously believe that ""Elton is a Genius, which comes out only once in 100 years or less. I really believe that Elton is a Genius. The proof of this is that Elton John is the only person who has released songs with such beautiful melody lines in a constant manner. I am looking forward to his further success in the future."
5,"Recently, tributes have been released in various places and are very popular. In some cases, such as Luther's, the tribute is in memory of his death, and in other cases, such as Toshinobu Kubota's, it is a reappraisal of his music. What makes this tribute album different from others is that the original source material is sampled and arranged to create something new. It's like a re-evaluation + reconstruction. 　Sly is a group that has a strong rock element within funk, and they have the ardent respect of the rock crowd, as evidenced by the fact that Steven Tyler of Aerosmith and maroon 5 are on the album. Honestly, Steven Tyler's 12 is numbing. These two shots are badass. 　The sampling is also a great example of how well hip-hop groups can do it. The BEP's will participation in 1 and Roots 3 is cool. The combination of CHUCK D,D'ANGELO&amp;ISAAC HAYES in 11 is also a great combination. 　I wish Prince, who is also a direct descendant of Sly, had joined. I guess he was busy making the album. But it is a good album, cool. If you bought it because your favorite artist was on it, please listen to Sly too. I personally think Stand is the best album."
2,"I like Kiyoji Hikawa a lot, but since his previous song ""Hanjiro"" sold well, he is going for a hit with ""Otojiro"" next. It's obvious that he is trying to make a hit with ""Otojiro"" next. Sales will follow! I wish you would put your heart and soul into your songwriting. But in the end, it was the personality of Kiyoji Hikawa that made the song a hit."
5,"This is one of my unconditional favorites and deserves to be called a masterpiece. With Katsumi's G and Professor's Key as the warp, the top class members of each instrument in Japan at that time interweave their own individuality into the groove, which is novel and dynamic, and does not feel old even if you listen to it now. Akko's P.P. and V.O. are especially important on this album, as she shows off her personality to the fullest. All the songs are good, but I personally like ""E-DAY"" and ""Water Ways Flow~"" in particular, and used to put them in my favorite compilation tapes. I often put my favorite songs on the compilation tapes."
2,"I heard someone talking before about how the album title of the new range sounds very natural, so I gave it a try and thought, ""What's so natural about it? I tried to listen to it and thought, ""What's Иatural about it? The songs except for the single songs were completely unheard of, and although the lyrics of the single songs were Иatural-like, the songs themselves didn't match the lyrics at all. I wish they would come up with a better title..."
5,"The melody is really beautiful! I don't think any artist can beat this beautiful melody and voice. To be honest, it was so beautiful that it gave me chills! I think M-8 ""dream and steps"" is the best song that utilizes its greatest weapon. Also, I personally think the way M-11 goes into M-12 is really good! I think if you listen to it enough times, you won't think that any of the songs are similar."
5,"I suddenly saw a nice jacket, so I rented it and saw it................pretty good! This was the first Haskin album I heard, so I was a bit shocked to hear the early and mid Haskin (but I like the 4th one...). The songs are interesting, and the lyrics are good. The songs are interesting and the lyrics are nice."
1,"I sure would like to know why such a song sold so well. I guess it's more in the category of ""crying songs,"" but I find myself laughing.　This is not real music."
2,"It was subtle. To be honest, I think the 1st album and the 2nd album are many times better.　REMINDER and MOTIONS are as good as the 1st and 2nd albums."
2,"CCCD again... That alone discourages me from buying it. It's a shame, because the songs on this album are great."
4,"I think her music is really 'taste' music. So I'm sure that after a year or so of savoring it, I will give it 5 stars. The mysterious power that overflows from the silence heals, encourages, and makes you think. This new work was just as I expected."
5,"The single cut ""Hey Jupiter"" has a nice feeling of sinking into the deep sea. Father Lucifer"" is a similar quiet song, but a bit more comical than ""Hey Jupiter. This is a good album with a sense of unity as a whole."
5,"I'm not sure if I can say that about this album, but it's a good album. FEEL got me...although I don't like some of the development from the chorus. But still, DISASTER reminded me of Pennywise. Well, as in a department store, each track has a different style, so I think most people will like at least one of them."
1,"There really are a lot of rotten artists in the Japanese music scene today. To be clear, this kind of thing is not rock. The low level of musicality is evident. Monotonous chord progressions, noisy drums, similar riffs, and a lot of useless sounds. It is shocking to think that this kind of thing is allowed to prevail. I hope that anyone who listens to this album will reconsider what rock music is and what music is all about."
5,"First of all, ""Karma"" was written for a game, but I thought it was a good song even though I am not a game player. I think it is a wonderful song that was written for a game, but it also touches the hearts of those who have not played the game. I thought this song was a bit bland at first, but after reading the magazine, I realized what Fujiwara had put into this song, and after listening to it many times, I fell in love with it. And I was still moved! By the way, I don't like the packaging of this CD as much as the regular edition, but the sound of ""limited edition"" won me over and I went with this one."
5,"Mr. Yoshida sings with all his might. The world of Dr. Dre's music spreads through the various rhythms, and before you know it, you are captivated by the music. It is a big band after all. You will be immersed in this world for a while."
5,The best part of their career is packed with the most exciting parts! The best part of their career is packed into this album!
1,Songs that would never sell without the backing of Johnny's. I pity those who are serious about making songs.
2,"Tracks 1, 3, and 8 on this album duplicate Sinead O'Connor's Sean-Nos Nua album, which came out about three years earlier. The Corrs' version is just a pop song. I had a chance to listen to some of their songs in a store, but my impression at the time was, ""What the heck, it's not Irish music at all, it's just modern pop music like Wilson Phillips. I had no interest in listening to it after that, but when I heard that they had released an album of Irish trad music, I bought it. I couldn't recommend it even to those who love and are familiar with the real Irish trad music played by The Chieftains and Altan, etc. I just thought, ""Well, it's all trad. However, I give it two stars because it is better than Celtic Woman because it is all trad."
5,"The slightly hard voice, the seriousness of the music, the clumsy tone and atmosphere of the voice... all of this is very typical of Thierria, don't you think? I feel that Ms. Kamiya expresses Thierria very well. To be honest, she is not an outstanding singer, but I think she expresses the character the best. I think this is the work of a voice actor who performs only with her voice."
4,"The difference between the thickness of the plastic case and the gap created by folding the outer paper is too large for the jacket of the first edition. The card is coming to the fold and it is cruel. The songs are very good, so I guess I prefer the standard edition to open the package."
1,"Ai Otsuka is a singer-songwriter, right? People who are serious about music, regardless of Western or Japanese music, must be inspired by other people's music, listening to it and studying it. So, they must be able to recognize similar songs and lyrics, right? If you call yourself a singer/songwriter, I want to hear music that you have created yourself. Even if you really don't know their songs, they are making a lot of noise, so you should listen to them and give your own opinion! If you can't proudly say that the song is yours, maybe you shouldn't release it. I know he won't admit it, but... if the audience feels the similarity, that is the most correct opinion."
5,"Recently, melodic heavy metal is becoming established as a genre, and I believe (at least for me) that the starting point of this genre is Halloween. And there is no doubt that this ""keeper of the seventh keys"" or ""Guardian Biographies Chapter II"" is the one that made a great leap forward in the establishment of the genre."
5,"I am usually a good sleeper, but on nights when I just can't sleep, I play this CD at a low volume. I originally bought this CD when I heard the song ""Onlytime"" in a CD set at an electronics store to try out the sound of the compressor, and I fell in love at first listen. The Enya songs on this CD are sometimes used as background music for news, etc., so you may be pleasantly surprised to find them on this CD."
5,"Originally, she debuted as a pure ""country singer"" and continued to have hits in the country field, and her albums with pop arrangements became big hits at the turn of the century, and she continues to do so today. Country Arrangements CD"
5,"I used to specialize in rock music, but when I saw this album, I was so shocked that I immediately bought it. The songs range from heartbreaking ballads that appeal to you to songs that will cheer you up, and I highly recommend listening to them when you need to cheer yourself up. This CD is a compilation of two albums released in their home country of Australia, and I think you can get to know Delta quite well with this one CD. If you are at all curious, please listen to it!"
5,"Since I hardly know the original songs, I simply enjoyed listening to them, and I think that BANKBAND also enjoys conveying its message, valuing the heart that music conveys. I think that we should not judge which songs are good or bad, but just enjoy them while receiving the message."
2,"If you love that grunge music of the second half of the second phase of the WANDS, this is for you. I definitely do not recommend it to anyone else! It's nice that they sing in a natural way, but this is no better than a song that was written at random. Rather, the demo track of 17 without lyrics left a better impression on me. By the way, the more times I listen to 14, the more I get hooked."
1,"After reading your scathing reviews of this album, I decided to purchase it out of curiosity and out of fear of what I might see or hear. My impression after listening to the song was just as everyone had criticized. I was impressed by the guts of Kumi Koda and Avex, saying, ""How could they release such a terrible song that is far beyond not good enough? The drama was not very good, and I had to admit that it was not very good. What I thought was particularly bad was 'WON'T BE LONG'. As a member of the generation that knows the song by the Bubblegum Brothers, I thought that the single released as a duet with EXILE was not a good fit for the song. This song is not suitable for a duet in the first place. It might have been better if EXILE had sung it alone. (In other words, Kumi Koda was the one who sang the song. (In other words, Kumi Koda was superfluous...) However, 'WON'T BE LONG' included in this album can only be said that both songs are utterly bad. The million-selling masterpiece 'WON'T BE LONG' is a total waste of time and money. It ruins it cruelly. The arrangement completely ignores the beauty and flavor of the original song, and the singing style gives no impression that the singer put his heart and soul into the song, making it unbearable to listen to. I am sure that the Bubblegum Brothers and others who agreed to cover ""WON'T BE LONG"" must be exclaiming, ""I didn't think the song would be this bad..."" I am sure that they must be regretting that they agreed to cover the song. I'm sure they regretted agreeing to do the cover. By the way, I regret that I bought this album."
2,"To be honest, it was a disappointment. I think the single songs are good, but the others did not leave a memorable impression. It's a shame, because the impact of the first one was so great. I will look forward to the next one!"
2,"The sound quality is too clear, and the music seems to have been created using DTM. The music is too neatly put together, so there is no sense of fun or playfulness in the music."
1,"I have been listening to Tatsuro for about 25 years. I have been listening to Tatsuro on and off since ""Ride On Time,"" but after listening to ""Sonorite"" one more time, I was disappointed. This is the first album that I don't think I will continue to play on repeat. I had some preliminary knowledge of the new album from SSB's new album feature, but that hammering sound was clearly unacceptable to me. The inclusion of single-released songs was fine, but the songs themselves lacked charm, the sound was digitally programmed and flat, and the vocals didn't match the backing sound as well as on previous albums. The vocals do not match the backing sound as well as on previous albums, and the heavy multiple choruses are overshadowed by the orchestral backing of the standards, which is completely unnecessary (please release such an album separately). It sounds good to say ""mature"" or ""contemporary,"" but the album as a whole is not very good, to say the least! If this is the evolution of Tatsuro's sound, we may never hear it again. Computer recording may be the norm nowadays, but I want to hear something that was basically recorded with a band sound."
5,A preview of the song played on the radio. What a great song~! I have a feeling that this song will be loved by people of all ages.
5,"On my morning commute, I am compelled to listen. To bring the frustration back to normalcy, I use the Backhaus piano. Backhaus is often spoken of as a German ticking pianist, but he is anything but. Moonlight, Pathetique, and Passion are all wonderful, but Waldstein's unique melodies are very impressive."
5,"This is the piece that completely fixed Billy's image. The hit ""Piano Man"" fixed Billy's image, but it was ""Bare Faced"" that completely cemented his image. What makes this album tricky is that the first two songs, ""Big Shot"" and ""Stranger,"" are up-tempo masterpieces, and Billy shouts all over them. Billy's voice is very gentle in ""Keep Your Face"" after making the listener think that he is not the same Billy who sang ""Piano Man. This difference in the tone of the song created Billy, the ""Bard of New York"". These three songs from the beginning of the album tell the story of how great this album is. As usual, there are no throw-away songs. This is a memorable album in which Billy's talent was demonstrated and recognized."
5,"This could be music like a temple. It has that kind of atmosphere. It is super dark and deep. It seems to suck you in. It is also mysterious and beautiful. If you like a fantastic world, you may listen to it. It makes you feel like you are going to trip a little."
2,"This is not an album by Kaori Muraji. The star of the show is The Sixteen's vocal and chorus. Muraji's guitar playing is only on easy pieces. Memories of the Alhambra"" and ""Song of the Thieves"" are works done by intermediate amateurs. They do not sound like the kind of performance that would make one think that he is a professional. Villa-Lobos also sounded mediocre after hearing Norihiko Watanabe's ""Phantom Live"" performance. The accompaniment to the songs (laia) is only easy. I don't feel the necessity to use guitar accompaniment. If you make albums with an easy attitude, it is certain that sales will decline in inverse proportion to your age. I would like to remind you of your high motivation when you made the all ""Rodrigo"" album ""Pastoral"". With more time, Muraji should be able to create something that will wow guitar fans. One more star is added because The Sixteen is wonderful."
1,"I think the first best album was a good album filled with Kumi Koda's 5 years. However, this album is a waste. It is an album for making money. It has no substance. It is probably the biggest waste of this century, created at the end of a project to play around with the idea of releasing the album 12 weeks in a row. It is an album that was made in a short period of time, so it has no substance. It was made in a short period of time, so it has no substance. I bought it because it was popular, but it's not something I can listen to over and over again. I don't think it was a waste of money, but it was the first bad album I've bought in a long time."
4,"It has been really disturbing, hasn't it? Cancellations, pregnancies and all that. I know there are some people who hate them because of that. But I'd like to write about them as characters and not as musicians, since they are the ones who provide the music. Their last album debuted at No. 1 in Japan. It also made over a million copies. All The Things She Said reached No. 1 in the UK. All The Things She Said reached No. 1 in the UK, and Not Gonna Get Us reached No. 7. Whatever the case may be, the music was quite catchy. And now, the first single ""All About Us"". The structure of the music is the same as All The Things She said. It's a safe line, but I think it's a song that will be accepted by the masses. But I think it is a song that is popular with the masses. Whether or not it will be in heavy rotation depends on the person who plays it, but at any rate, it's a song that can be enjoyed by everyone. It's worth a listen. The girls are in the midst of a crucial period, but I think they can make another comeback depending on how they tackle it. They have pulled down such good songs. So please don't hate them and give them one more chance. Please give them one more chance. But the American version has a cheesy jacket: 。。。。"
2,"It flows gently and slowly and is great for easy listening. It could be used for background music at cafes and weddings. And I...etc., it's still so perfect that I wonder how you play it all by yourself! However, I knew this album was going to be released, but I didn't have the purchasing power to want to buy it on the day of release and own it as soon as possible, so I got it now.... I had no purchasing power to want to buy it on the day of release or to own it as soon as possible......because I knew all the songs and could imagine them.... 　This time it was a cover, last time it was a session, and it was not so bad, but as a fan, I would like to have a feast of Oshio's original songs by releasing an album of all new songs. Next time, I hope for something that is not a copy or a session."
2,"I wish they had done something about the jacket design... (It's not a rock CD*). (It is not a rock CD☆) I guess it is a reference to ""Sword Dance,"" but the fact that the conductor's baton is a sword gives an offensive impression, and I don't like it. I think it is a little too bad taste for classical music fans to add to their CD collections, and I would lose interest in buying it. I think EMI should have hired a jacket designer with a different taste or had the jacket re-designed (if you have a chance, please advise EMI). (If you have a chance, please advise EMI.) Since interest in this composer has been growing since Mao's graceful performance in skating, I wanted the classical jacket to have dignity so as not to destroy the image of this composer. Please note that the number of ★ in the rating is not for the music itself. --Khachaturian was originally the son of a poor bookbinder who could not read music and had no formal musical education until the age of 18. However, he grew up in an environment filled with folk music, and was allowed to enter a music school where he could freely recite and skillfully play nearly 100 folk songs on the piano, eventually becoming one of Russia's greatest composers. --When you listen to the concert with this in mind, you can feel Khachaturian's soul as a ""human being"" even more. This is a precious sound recording of the orchestra conducted by Khachaturian himself. Only the jacket is a real pity. If there were a product with the same content and a more desirable CD jacket, many people would choose that. I was looking for a Khachaturian CD, but I chose this product otherwise."
4,"I like Rachmaninoff so much that I have many copies of his Piano Concerto No. 2 alone, but this performance is simply wonderful. The slightly slow flow effectively brings out the grandeur and delicacy of the music and leaves a deep impression. There is no end to the details, but I would rate this performance as a work of art."
1,"I only knew Sarah Brightman's song from the news station, but I bought the album expecting other songs and became disillusioned at once. It is not worthy of the title ""DIVA""."
4,"But I was relieved to hear a very good song. Faith is a song from the drama Unfair. I had seen the drama, so I was deeply impressed with the fit of the song to the drama. She still plays beautiful high notes. Pureyes is a commercial song for a contact lens. This one is up-tempo. This one is also very good, so please listen to it as well as Faith. She really got a good song. I hope the record company will continue to take good care of her. Mika Nakajima has become a very good singer, and I am sure she will get better in the future as well."
5,"Gackt's refreshing voice. But for some reason, when you listen to it, it makes your heart ache and you feel sad. And when you finish listening to it, you will be cheered up with courage. It is such a song. 　It is a gentle love song that you can always go back and listen to. It is a great song."
2,"I was quite excited to see the phrases on this album, as it is their first album in 7 years. The impression I got after listening to it was a ? I can't get rid of that feeling no matter how many times I repeat it. Next, I thought that it didn't need to be a two-disc set at all, and I realized that it was by far the worst album of Southern's albums. I am worried that this album will be another downfall of the band, which seemed to have made a complete comeback after the big hit ""TSUNAMI"" in 2000 and Kuwata's solo. As a fan for 25 years, I hope the next album will be a masterpiece that can surpass the 80's Sazan. However, I wish this album was not a two-disc set."
5,"After all, Junichi Inagaki's original albums are the best. Among them, ""Shine on Me,"" ""1969 no Katasoi,"" and ""Sincerely Onesti"" are J.I. Pearl's masterpieces♪."
5,"The first CD I bought was this Michael McDonald album and, I believe, Synchronicity by the Police. I remember that the price was 2800 to 3000 yen per CD at an import disc shop. Of course, it was at a major import disc store, around the time this album was released. I remember I was in my first year of college.  Personally, it is still the best AOR album along with Boz's series of masterpiece albums. Especially, the second track is the best."
4,"The limited time production version (with DVD of OP & ED video) is ""Label Gate CD2"" which was adopted at that time for copy control. The duplication service ended at the end of March 2008, so you cannot import it to your PC. This is fine if you are purchasing for the DVD or if you do not plan to import it to an iPod or other device, but please be careful."
4,"I regretted a little that I should have chosen III right after I bought this CD, but after listening to it, I am very satisfied with it! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I want to give 5 stars to III. This best seems to include some different takes from the original, and due to the remastering, it doesn't sound so old-fashioned. Old fans will feel more excitement than nostalgia! However, as for the songs from III (9 out of 10, including 2 live), as some other reviewers have pointed out, they sound almost the same as on the record. The success of a Japanese rock band abroad depends not on its enka-esque melodies or Japanese concepts, but on how the songs carry the DNA of the Japanese people. I think one of the few successful examples of this was Kyoji Yamamoto's solo albums Electric Cinema and VOWWOWIII. Mr. Yamamoto once said in an interview that he could not surpass III when he produced the albums after III, and I was able to recognize again how miraculous III was. Now that it has been reissued (I missed the chance to buy it the last time it was on OTOZO... and I didn't know about it this time either until recently...), I intend to buy III as well."
5,The band's typical sound is very good. I am still impressed every time I listen to it!
2,"Of course I will get it, it's a ""palace"". I've been inertia like that, and this is my seventh CD since it came out on CD, just the Japanese version. (Is this what the makers want?) I hope this is the end of paper jackets, because there is no end to them. This time, being HQCD and having been remastered, I would like to make this the last ""palace"" for me. I'm sure there will be some kind of commemoration or some kind of material in the future, though... Oh, as for the content, it's 5 stars."
1,"If you are only interested in ""Let it be"" or ""Yesterday"", you should go for Beatles 1. If you are only interested in ""Let it be"" or ""Yesterday"", you can get that one. (Few people put out such a conscientious compilation! I can't tell you how many duplicates I had to go through to get all the Stones songs...) The red and blue discs are half-assed in comparison! I think you have to like the Beatles to some extent when you buy or are thinking of buying two sets of these two albums. If you are thinking of buying two such sets, I think you like the Beatles to some extent. If there are people who are not interested in buying albums with many duplicated songs because they already have the red and blue albums, I think they are losing more than money. If you have the red and blue discs, you can enjoy the whole album, so you lose about 7,000 yen. On the other hand, if you liked only half of the songs, you would lose about 5,000 yen for the difference between ""1"" and ""2"". If you like most of the songs on Red/Blue but don't like the ones not on Red/Blue, then it's a win-win situation, but I've never seen such a person. ● Certainly this selection of songs is quite good (especially the blue disc). But nowadays it is easy to record with high quality sound, so you can collect sound sources and make your own. You can also have fun by changing the song selection a little bit according to your own taste. (By the way, I would add I saw her, Ask me why, Twist & shout, If I fell, and Taxman) ●If you have strong feelings for the red and blue discs as ""objects"", you should frame the LP jackets from those days and display them. ●Let's think again about the meaning of buying a best-of album. The merit of a best-of album is that you can pick up only the best songs at a low cost. But in the case of the Beatles, more than 200 of their 213 songs are good songs (a bit of an exaggeration), so there is no need for a best-of album. Most of the albums are of higher quality than the best albums of other artists! ● It is true that it is expensive and hard to listen to all Beatles songs. But it is much more worthwhile to buy 10 Beatles albums than to buy 1,000 albums of Western music from the 80's onward. I thought afterwards that it was out of place to write a scathing review here. I thought later that it was out of place to write a scathing review here, since people who own all the albums wouldn't be looking at this page. Please buy Red and Blue! But I have one request. Please don't be the kind of person who thinks he understands the Beatles and talks about rock music when he only listens to Red and Blue. I'm sure there are a lot of anti-Beatles people who come here, lol. But I'm not the kind of person who doesn't accept anything but the Beatles. Do you think such a person would listen to the Pirates or Chatmonchy? But I can understand why people don't understand the Beatles. The reason for that was that when I experienced Elvis Costello for the first time much later, I thought, ""They sound like Miss Chill"" (laughs). That's how you feel, right? So the earlier you listen to the Beatles, the better. At the latest, by the age of 20! One last word. People who only accept the Beatles are not qualified to talk about rock music. People who don't listen to the Beatles are not qualified to talk about music. That's all for now!"
4,"The sound is clearer. That is the only impression I have. If possible, I wish they would remaster the original albums and release them in real stereo instead of pseudo-stereo. There were plenty of different mixes and versions of the Beatles in the analog era, and if the sound is improved by remastering, I have no complaints!"
1,"I bought a CD of desperado songs to learn them, but the lyrics are not on the CD, even though I ordered it from UK. Are you sure it is not a bootleg CD? It is not an official CD!　I will look up the lyrics (Lyrics) on the internet!　Darn it!"
5,"This is the official live album of the Eagles. It starts with ""Hotel California"" and draws the audience in at once. The guitar solo is far better than the studio version. The studio version ends with a fade-out, but this live version, which ends with a sharp cut-out, will give you goosebumps! It is worth buying just for this one song. Rock numbers such as ""Heartache Tonight,"" ""Long Run,"" and ""Life on the Run"" are even cooler than the studio version. Most of the songs are from the Long Run tour, but fans can rest assured that ""Take It to the Limit"" still features Randy Meisner on lead vocals before he left the band. This is one of the highlights of the album, and it is one of the songs that Randy entered. I highly recommend that those who liked this song in the studio version listen to it. Other songs such as ""Seven Bridges Road"" and ""New Kid in Town,"" which begin a cappella, have their own choruses that are even more beautiful and haunting. Don Henley's deadpan voice on ""Time Flies By"" and ""The Rogue"" is also wonderful. The final song is their theme song, ""Take It Easy"". At first glance, the order of the songs may seem reversed, but the order is exquisite. It is also impressive that they changed the word ""Arizona"" to ""California"" in the lyrics and got a big cheer from the audience. I recommend this album to everyone, including those who have listened to all of the original albums, those who have only heard the best of the Eagles or their masterpieces, and those who have not yet heard the Eagles."
5,"In a word, the lyrics of the second song, ""Rock 'n' Roll Fire,"" sum up the entirety of the ""God's Dog"" album.... But then...well...this is the biggest work ever...! From the occultic God's Dog meeting scene where the guru's wicked son makes a revelation to the very end.......as well as the impact of each song, it makes sense to listen to the entire album in its entirety. When you finish listening to all the songs, you will get goosebumps to say the least! This is exactly what Inugami Circus-dan ！！！！！ This is exactly what Inugami Circus-dan is all about. I highly recommend this album to all Inugami Circus-dan fans, as well as to those who have never heard of Inugami Circus-dan! By the way, I personally think it's really cool when they go from ""Revelation"" to ""Rock 'n' Roll Fire""."
4,"The second release of the keyboard trio is an ambitious attempt to revive progressive music in a new era, featuring vocals on all songs. While using the usual prog-rock clichés such as heavy sounds and odd time signatures, the band also employs decadent melodic themes such as ""Rendevous 6:02"" and ""Caeser's Palace Blues"" and makes extensive use of polyphonic synths, which is typical of the late 1970s sound. Of course, the superb drumming of newcomer Terry Bozio and the technical keyboard playing of nobleman Eddie Jobson can also be fully enjoyed."
5,"This is Paul Jackson Jr.'s fourth album as a leader, released in November 1995 and reissued on CD in December 2008. This CD is the December 2008 reissue. The Hi Quality CD is a CD for music with high sound quality, using polycarbonate used for LCD panels as the disc base material and a special alloy for the reflective film instead of conventional aluminum, which is a higher grade than normal CDs. As for the contents of the CD, in the words of the liner notes of the Japanese edition, ""In the duets, he interacts with saxophone, keyboards, vocals, bass, etc., to give us real music with imagination and heart..."" The guest musicians with whom he duets are also Harvard musicians, and the music is performed by the same musicians as on the CD. His duet partners include Harvey Mason, Earl Crews, Tom Scott, Ray Parker, Joe Sample, Wilton Felder, George Duke, Sheila E., and a host of others. Jazz/fusion with a hint of the American West Coast, Paul Jackson, Jr. also takes an exhilarating and mellow solo. He is a guitarist with a great sound, and I like him very much. The sixth song, ""Knight Time,"" in particular, features Joe Sample's keyboards, Wilton Felder's saxophone solo, and George Bohannon's trombone, and Paul Jackson, Jr. It's refreshing, mellow, moderately fast, and very pleasant to listen to. I highly recommend it."
2,"＞Melodic hard rock in the vein of Winger, Journey, Bad English, etc. It's more like Def Leppard or Y&T's ""Contagious"".... ＞It's a lot cooler than Toto. When are you referring to TOTO? (lol) I think the first TOTO album is a hundred times better looking. ＞Thunder and Lightning"" starts with a long intro with superb guitar. 25 seconds. Isn't it a normal intro? (Chained"" Is this the highlight of the album? It's too dull to listen to the end. ＞Lost in Paradise"" The rhythm is also too dull.... I believed the rumors again and wasted my money ... . I give it 67 out of 100."
2,"As the introduction says, pop and catchy melody. But that's all there is to it, and there are no other elements to attract you. It lacks depth and is not addictive, so you get tired of it after a few listens. It may be good as an introductory album to Western music."
2,"I'm disappointed in EXILE these days! I can see TAKAHIRO's growth, but in what direction is he going? But I'm still an EX fan, so I'll give it 2 stars with high expectations."
1,"As for the new song, I personally think it is sad and nice. However, I am not sure what they want to do with the PV featuring Mr. Yanaka, or the collaboration song. And then there is the debut song in question. I also don't understand why they released this song at this time of the year when it doesn't even seem to be a commemoration. The PV seems as if EXILE started with 5 members. And now it seems as if EXILE started with 5 members and became the current 7 members. What do they want to tell their fans? I think the fans who have been supporting them since their debut have a lot to think about. This is too sad. I don't know what happened, but I wish they would stop this way of revealing the back side of the story."
2,"I was quite disappointed with the three best albums, but now it's come to that... I wonder if there are people who will buy this. I'll give it 2 stars because the lack of new songs and special offers makes it a good deal for avex."
1,"Are you nuts? I think it's not worth the price of the box, and if you collect used ones, it's probably less than 8,000 yen. Needless to say, the contents are less than 1 star."
1,"I'm starting to enjoy this much more, and I'm wondering how they will market their products in the future.... Minami is also not going to get Avex's money. Minami, please think carefully about how to spend your money so that it does not end up in Avex's coffers. I will buy this album. And I will be watching your future activities not as a fan but as a product. This album is going to be at a premium..."
1,"For example, if you say you listen to Kumi Koda, people will think you are stupid too. It is not beneficial to advertise your stupidity on TV."
5,"The first song on the DVD is a PV full of fight scenes that are available to the public. The second song is a close-up of Yamashita-kun, who sings the whole time with a sad expression on his face.... I sat on my knees in front of the TV and stared at each other! The profile of her face when she was beaten up in a fight, her bruised lips.... Sexy Tomohisa is in full bloom. Fans should definitely buy this one! I mean, it's already a family heirloom! The third song is a karaoke version sung together with Yama P. The last song is cute and playful. The last song is an off-shot of her cute and mischievous face. The arrangement of the CD's coupling song ""Ring"" has changed a lot, but it's still a nice, melancholy, Latin-inspired song."
1,"I love the anime that the opening song is from and I can't help but hear it, but this is the worst song in the anime series. The vocals are grating, the rap is poor and poor word choice, and it's painful to listen to for 6 months. I hate it."
2,"The members have been replaced, and the tune of the song has changed completely. The previous songs were lively and flirtatious (that was my impression), but this time the songs are stronger and more solid. The song itself is neither good nor bad. I had high expectations for this single before it came out, so I am a little disappointed.  If you listen to it as ""New Antique Coffee Shop,"" it may not be so bad."
4,"In 1997, I was a bit bored by all the Da Funk music in London, but listening to it now, including Around the world, it's still pretty good."
